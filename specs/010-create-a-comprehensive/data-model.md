**Date**: 2025-09-29  
**Feature**: 010-create-a-comprehensive  
**Purpose**: Define entities and data structures for the integration testing system

## Core Entities

### 1. Test Suite

**Purpose**: Collection of related tests targeting specific integration scenarios

- `prerequisites` must reference valid service names

**State Transitions**: 
Not_Started → Running → Completed/Failed

- `response_status` must be valid HTTP status code when present
- `retry_count` must not exceed configured maximum

**Relationships**: 
- Belongs to exactly one Test Case
- Part of one Test Execution Session

### 4. Test Execution Session

**Purpose**: Complete test run session with overall results and metadata

**Fields**:
- `session_id`: String - Unique identifier for the test session
- `start_timestamp`: DateTime - When the test session began
- `end_timestamp`: DateTime - When the test session completed
- `environment`: String - Environment where tests were executed (local, docker, staging)

- `total_tests`: Integer - Total number of test cases executed
- `passed_tests`: Integer - Number of tests that passed
- `failed_tests`: Integer - Number of tests that failed
- `skipped_tests`: Integer - Number of tests that were skipped
- `error_tests`: Integer - Number of tests that had execution errors
- `overall_status`: Enum - Session result (passed, failed, partial)
- `execution_results`: Array[TestExecutionResult] - All individual test results
- `performance_summary`: Object - Aggregate performance metrics
- `environment_info`: Object - System information (docker versions, service versions)

**Validation Rules**:
- `session_id` must be unique across all sessions
- `end_timestamp` must be after `start_timestamp`
- `total_tests` must equal sum of passed, failed, skipped, and error counts
- `overall_status` = passed only if `failed_tests` + `error_tests` = 0

### 5. Service Configuration

**Purpose**: Environment-specific configuration for services under test

**Fields**:
- `service_name`: String - Name of the service (matches service directory names)
- `base_url`: String - Base URL for API calls to this service
- `health_endpoint`: String - Health check endpoint path (default: "/health")
- `ready_endpoint`: String - Readiness check endpoint path (default: "/health/ready")
- `docs_endpoint`: String - API documentation endpoint (default: "/docs")
- `requires_auth`: Boolean - Whether this service requires authentication
- `startup_wait_seconds`: Integer - Time to wait for service startup
- `health_check_timeout`: Integer - Timeout for health check calls
- `database_required`: Boolean - Whether service needs database connectivity
- `dependencies`: Array[String] - Other services this service depends on

**Validation Rules**:
- `service_name` must match existing service names in the project
- `base_url` must be valid URL format
- `startup_wait_seconds` must be between 0 and 120
- `health_check_timeout` must be between 1 and 30
- `dependencies` must reference valid service names

### 6. Authentication Context

**Purpose**: JWT token and authentication state for testing authenticated endpoints

**Validation Rules**:
- `access_token` must be valid JWT format
- `expires_at` must be in the future for active tokens
- `user_email` must be valid email format
- `token_type` should be "Bearer" for JWT tokens

**Security Considerations**:
- Tokens should be generated fresh for each test session
- Test user accounts should have minimal required permissions
- Tokens should be invalidated after test completion

## Data Relationships

```
Test Suite (1) ←→ (many) Test Case
Test Case (1) ←→ (many) Test Execution Result  
Test Execution Session (1) ←→ (many) Test Execution Result
Service Configuration (1) ←→ (many) Test Case
Authentication Context (1) ←→ (many) Test Execution Session
```

## Database Schema Considerations

**Note**: This integration testing system primarily operates in-memory during execution and generates file-based reports. Database persistence is not required for the core functionality.

**File-Based Storage**:
- Test configurations: YAML/JSON files in `tests/config/`
- Test results: JSON files with timestamps in `tests/results/`
- Test reports: Markdown/HTML files in `tests/reports/`

**In-Memory Processing**:
- Test execution state managed in memory during test runs
- Results accumulated and written to files at completion
- Authentication tokens maintained in memory for security

## Performance Considerations

**Memory Usage**:
- Test suites loaded lazily to minimize memory footprint
- Response bodies truncated for large payloads (>1KB)
- Test results streamed to files rather than accumulated in memory

**Execution Efficiency**:
- Parallel execution for independent test suites
- Connection pooling for HTTP clients
- Early termination on critical test failures

## Error Handling Patterns

**Test Execution Errors**:
- Network connectivity issues → Retry with exponential backoff
- Service not ready → Wait with timeout and clear error message
- Authentication failures → Clear token refresh guidance
- Database connectivity → Specific PostgreSQL connection troubleshooting

**Validation Errors**:
- Invalid test configuration → Clear schema validation messages
- Missing prerequisites → List missing services/dependencies
- Timeout exceeded → Performance optimization suggestions
