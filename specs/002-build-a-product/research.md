# Research Report: Product Catalog Service

**Date**: 2025-09-23
**Feature**: Product Catalog Service for Project Zero App

## Research Overview

This research focuses on implementing a product catalog service using established patterns from the existing auth-service, ensuring consistency and simplicity while meeting the specific requirements for product management in an e-commerce context.

## Technology Stack Decisions

### FastAPI Framework
**Decision**: Use FastAPI as the web framework
**Rationale**:
- Matches existing auth-service pattern for consistency
- Automatic OpenAPI documentation generation
- Built-in Pydantic validation for request/response models
- High performance and modern async support
- Excellent development experience with automatic API docs

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Flask: More basic, would require additional dependencies for OpenAPI docs
- Django: Too heavy for a microservice, doesn't match project patterns

### Database Layer
**Decision**: SQLAlchemy ORM with SQLite (dev) / PostgreSQL (prod)
**Rationale**:
- Matches auth-service database approach
- SQLAlchemy provides excellent ORM capabilities with declarative models
- SQLite for development simplicity (no external dependencies)
- PostgreSQL production path for scalability
- Constitutional requirement for consistent technology stack

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Raw SQL: More complex, less maintainable
- MongoDB: Document DB not needed for structured product data

### Authentication Integration
**Decision**: HTTP calls to auth-service at http://localhost:8001/auth/verify
**Rationale**:
- Stateless service design (constitutional requirement)
- Leverages existing auth infrastructure
- Simple HTTP-based verification for admin endpoints
- No need to duplicate auth logic or share JWT secrets

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Shared JWT secret: Would require configuration coordination
- Database-shared auth: Would violate service boundaries

## API Design Patterns

### REST Endpoint Structure
**Decision**: Standard REST patterns with specific e-commerce enhancements
**Rationale**:
- GET /products - List with pagination (industry standard)
- GET /products/{id} - Individual resource (REST convention)
- GET /products/category/{category} - Collection filtering (intuitive)
- GET /products/search?q={query} - Search via query parameter (standard)
- POST /products - Resource creation (REST convention)
- PUT /products/{id} - Resource update (REST convention)

### Pagination Strategy
**Decision**: Offset-based pagination with limit/offset query parameters
**Rationale**:
- Simple to implement and understand
- Sufficient for demo application scale
- Follows common REST API patterns
- Easy frontend integration

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Cursor-based: More complex, not needed for demo scale
- Page numbers: Less flexible than offset/limit

### Response Format
**Decision**: Consistent JSON with envelope pattern for lists
**Rationale**:
```json
{
  "items": [...],
  "total": 100,
  "offset": 0,
  "limit": 20,
  "has_more": true
}
```
- Clear pagination metadata
- Consistent structure across endpoints
- Frontend-friendly format

## Data Model Design

### Product Entity
**Decision**: Single Product table with embedded category (enum/string)
**Rationale**:
- Simple approach meeting demo requirements
- All required fields specified in requirements
- Category as string/enum sufficient for 4-5 categories
- No complex relationships needed for demo scope

**Fields**:
- id: Integer primary key
- name: String (required)
- description: Text (required)
- price: Decimal (required)
- category: String enum (required)
- image_url: String (required)
- stock_quantity: Integer (required)
- is_active: Boolean (default True)
- created_at, updated_at: Timestamps

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Separate Category table: Over-engineering for demo scope
- JSON fields: Would complicate querying

### Sample Data Strategy
**Decision**: Database seeding with hardcoded sample products
**Rationale**:
- Provides immediate demo value
- 20+ products across electronics, clothing, books, home goods
- Realistic price ranges and descriptions
- Executed on application startup

## Error Handling Patterns

### HTTP Status Codes
**Decision**: Standard HTTP status codes with structured error responses
**Rationale**:
- 200: Successful retrieval
- 201: Successful creation
- 400: Validation errors (Pydantic)
- 401: Authentication required (admin endpoints)
- 404: Resource not found
- 422: Validation errors
- 500: Server errors

### Error Response Format
**Decision**: Consistent error envelope
```json
{
  "detail": "Error message",
  "type": "validation_error",
  "errors": [...]
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Database Indexing
**Decision**: Strategic indexes on commonly queried fields
- id: Primary key (automatic)
- category: For category filtering
- name: For search functionality (with text search)
- is_active: For filtering active products

### Caching Strategy
**Decision**: No caching for initial implementation
**Rationale**: Constitutional "simplicity first" principle; add caching only when needed

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
**Decision**: Pydantic models for all request/response validation
**Rationale**:
- Automatic validation with clear error messages
- Type safety and documentation
- Consistent with FastAPI patterns

### Admin Endpoint Protection
**Decision**: Middleware/dependency for auth verification
**Rationale**:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Reusable across admin endpoints
- HTTP call to auth-service for verification

## Deployment Considerations

### Docker Configuration
**Decision**: Multi-stage Dockerfile matching auth-service pattern
**Rationale**:
- Consistency with existing services
- Production optimization
- Constitutional requirement

### Environment Variables
**Decision**: Minimal environment configuration
- DATABASE_URL: Database connection
- AUTH_SERVICE_URL: Auth service endpoint
- PORT: Service port (default 8004)
- LOG_LEVEL: Logging configuration

## Testing Strategy

### Test Structure
**Decision**: Three-tier testing approach
**Rationale**:
1. Unit tests: Model validation, business logic
2. Integration tests: Database operations, API endpoints
3. Contract tests: API specification compliance

### Test Tools
**Decision**: pytest with FastAPI TestClient
**Rationale**:
- Matches auth-service testing approach
- Excellent FastAPI integration
- Constitutional requirement

## Summary

This research establishes a clear technical foundation for the product catalog service that:
- Follows constitutional principles (simplicity, consistency)
- Matches established auth-service patterns
- Meets all functional requirements from the specification
- Provides a solid foundation for demonstration purposes
- Can be extended for production needs

The approach prioritizes simplicity and consistency over premature optimization, aligning with the constitutional mandate for demo-focused development.
