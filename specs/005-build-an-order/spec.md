# Feature Specification: Order Processing Service

**Feature Branch**: `005-build-an-order`
**Created**: 2025-09-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build an order processing service for the Project Zero App e-commerce platform. This service manages the complete order lifecycle from cart checkout to order completion. Users should be able to create orders from their current cart, view their order history, track order status, and get order details. The service should handle the checkout process by converting cart items into order items, calculating totals including taxes and shipping, managing order status transitions (pending, confirmed, processing, shipped, delivered, cancelled), and maintaining order history for users. Include endpoints for creating orders from cart, retrieving user order history, getting specific order details, and updating order status (admin only). The service should integrate with the cart service to retrieve cart contents, auth service for user verification, and product catalog service for product details and inventory updates. Orders should include customer information, shipping address, order items with pricing snapshot, totals, and timestamps. Keep the order model comprehensive but focused on core e-commerce order management functionality."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Extracted: Order processing service for e-commerce lifecycle
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: customers, admin users
   ’ Actions: checkout, view history, track status, update status
   ’ Data: orders, order items, shipping addresses, pricing snapshots
   ’ Constraints: order status workflow, pricing calculations, service integrations
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Primary flow: cart checkout to order completion
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities (order, order item, shipping address)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ Spec ready for planning phase
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A customer completes their shopping experience by converting their cart items into a formal order with shipping details and payment processing. They can then track their order through various status stages from confirmation to delivery, and access their complete order history for reference and reordering.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a customer has items in their cart and valid shipping address, **When** they initiate checkout, **Then** an order is created with all cart items, calculated totals, and initial "pending" status
2. **Given** a customer has placed an order, **When** they request their order history, **Then** they see all their orders with basic details (order number, date, total, status)
3. **Given** a customer wants order details, **When** they request a specific order, **Then** they see complete order information including items, pricing breakdown, shipping address, and current status
4. **Given** an order exists in the system, **When** an admin updates the order status, **Then** the order progresses through the workflow (pending ’ confirmed ’ processing ’ shipped ’ delivered)
5. **Given** an order needs to be cancelled, **When** cancellation is requested, **Then** the order status changes to "cancelled" and inventory is updated appropriately

### Edge Cases
- What happens when cart items are no longer available during checkout?
- How does system handle inventory conflicts during order creation?
- What occurs when shipping address validation fails?
- How are pricing discrepancies handled between cart and order creation?
- What happens when order status transitions are invalid (e.g., shipped to pending)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-005**: System MUST manage order status transitions through defined workflow (pending, confirmed, processing, shipped, delivered, cancelled)
- **FR-006**: Customers MUST be able to view their complete order history
- **FR-007**: Customers MUST be able to retrieve detailed information for any of their orders
- **FR-008**: System MUST track order creation timestamps and status change timestamps

- **FR-010**: System MUST verify product availability and inventory during order creation
- **FR-011**: Admin users MUST be able to update order status for fulfillment tracking
- **FR-012**: System MUST prevent invalid status transitions (e.g., delivered to pending)
- **FR-013**: System MUST maintain order history permanently for customer reference
- **FR-014**: System MUST validate shipping address format and completeness

[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Tax calculation method not specified - fixed rate, location-based, or external tax service?]
[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Shipping cost calculation not defined - flat rate, weight-based, location-based, or carrier integration?]
[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Payment processing integration scope - does this service handle payment or just order tracking?]
[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Admin user authorization levels not specified - single admin role or multiple permission levels?]
[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Order modification policy not defined - can orders be modified after creation, or only status updates?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Order**: Represents a customer's purchase commitment with items, totals, shipping details, and lifecycle status tracking
- **Order Item**: Individual product entries within an order, capturing quantity, unit price, and total price at time of order creation
- **Shipping Address**: Customer delivery location including full address details, contact information for delivery coordination
- **Order Status**: Workflow state indicator tracking order progression from initial creation through fulfillment completion
