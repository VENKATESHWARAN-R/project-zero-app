# Feature Specification: Payment Processing Service

**Feature Branch**: `006-build-a-payment`  
**Created**: 2025-09-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a payment processing service for the Project Zero App e-commerce platform. This service handles payment processing for orders including payment method management, payment processing, and payment status tracking. Since this is a demo application, implement a mock payment gateway that simulates real payment processing without actual financial transactions. Users should be able to process payments for orders, check payment status, and handle payment confirmations or failures. The service should support different payment methods (credit card, debit card, PayPal simulation), process payment requests with order details, return payment confirmation or failure responses, and maintain payment transaction history. Include endpoints for processing payments, checking payment status, retrieving payment history for orders, and handling payment webhooks (simulated). The service should integrate with the order service to update order status based on payment results and with the auth service for user verification. Keep payment data secure but remember this is a mock implementation for demonstration purposes. Payment responses should be realistic but always successful for demo purposes unless specifically testing failure scenarios."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature description provided: Payment processing service for e-commerce platform
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: customers, system administrators
   ‚Üí Actions: process payments, check status, manage payment methods, track history
   ‚Üí Data: payment transactions, payment methods, order details, user information
   ‚Üí Constraints: mock implementation, demo purposes, integration with existing services
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All key aspects are clearly defined in the description
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flows identified for payment processing
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements are testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Payment transactions, payment methods, payment history identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No clarifications needed, no implementation details included
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a customer of the Project Zero App e-commerce platform, I want to securely pay for my orders using various payment methods so that I can complete my purchases and receive my products. The system should provide immediate feedback on payment status and maintain a history of all my transactions for reference.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a customer has items in their cart and proceeds to checkout, **When** they select a payment method and submit payment details, **Then** the system processes the payment and confirms successful completion
2. **Given** a customer has submitted a payment, **When** they check their payment status, **Then** the system displays the current status (processing, completed, or failed)
3. **Given** a customer wants to view their payment history, **When** they access their transaction history, **Then** the system displays all their past payments with details
4. **Given** a payment fails during processing, **When** the system detects the failure, **Then** it notifies the customer and provides options to retry or use alternative payment methods
5. **Given** a payment is successfully processed, **When** the payment confirmation is received, **Then** the system updates the corresponding order status to paid
6. **Given** an administrator needs to monitor payments, **When** they access payment management tools, **Then** they can view all payment transactions and their statuses

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a payment method is declined or invalid?
- How does the system handle partial payments or refunds?
- What occurs when the payment service is temporarily unavailable?
- How are duplicate payment attempts prevented?
- What happens when webhook notifications are delayed or lost?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST process payments for orders using multiple payment methods (credit card, debit card, PayPal simulation)
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate payment information before processing transactions
- **FR-003**: System MUST return immediate confirmation or failure responses for payment attempts
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain a complete history of all payment transactions
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide real-time payment status tracking for customers
- **FR-006**: System MUST integrate with the order service to update order status based on payment results
- **FR-007**: System MUST authenticate users through integration with the auth service before processing payments
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle simulated webhook notifications for payment status updates
- **FR-009**: System MUST prevent duplicate payment processing for the same order
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide secure handling of payment data (even in mock implementation)
- **FR-011**: System MUST support payment method management for registered users
- **FR-012**: System MUST generate realistic payment responses for demonstration purposes
- **FR-013**: System MUST allow administrators to view and monitor all payment transactions
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide endpoints for retrieving payment history filtered by user or order
- **FR-015**: System MUST simulate realistic payment processing delays and responses
- **FR-016**: System MUST handle payment failures gracefully and provide meaningful error messages
- **FR-017**: System MUST log all payment activities for audit and debugging purposes
- **FR-018**: System MUST support testing scenarios for both successful and failed payments

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Payment Transaction**: Represents a single payment attempt with amount, payment method, status, timestamps, and associated order/user information
- **Payment Method**: Represents stored payment information for users including type (credit/debit/PayPal), masked details, and validation status
- **Payment History**: Aggregated view of all payment transactions for a user or order, including status changes and timestamps
- **Payment Status**: Current state of a payment (pending, processing, completed, failed, cancelled) with transition tracking
- **Webhook Event**: Simulated external payment gateway notifications for status updates and confirmations
