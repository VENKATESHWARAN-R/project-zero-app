# Project Zero App Constitution

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-09-23 | **Last Amended**: 2025-09-23

## Article I: Core Philosophy

### 1.1 Simplicity First
Every technical decision MUST prioritize simplicity over complexity. When multiple solutions exist, choose the one that is easiest to understand, maintain, and debug. Complex solutions are only acceptable when simpler alternatives fail to meet functional requirements.

**Rationale**: Complexity is the enemy of maintainability and security. Simple systems are easier to debug, test, and extend.

### 1.2 Functionality Over Architecture
Working features take precedence over elaborate architectural patterns. Implement the minimum viable solution first, then refactor for scale only when requirements demand it.

**Rationale**: Over-engineering leads to wasted effort and delayed delivery. Focus on solving real problems rather than anticipated ones.

### 1.3 Progressive Enhancement
Start with minimal implementations and add complexity incrementally based on actual requirements. Each enhancement MUST be justified by demonstrable need.

**Rationale**: Requirements evolve, and premature optimization often solves the wrong problems.

### 1.4 Demo-Focused Development
All implementations MUST prioritize demonstrable features over production-scale optimizations. The primary goal is showcasing AI-powered DevOps and security tooling capabilities.

**Rationale**: This application serves as a demonstration platform for Project Zero, not a production e-commerce system.

## Article II: Project Organization

### 2.1 Service Structure
All services and features MUST be organized under the `services/` directory with consistent naming:
- Service directories MUST follow the pattern: `{service-name}-service/`
- Each service MUST be self-contained with its own dependencies and configuration
- Services MUST implement a single, well-defined responsibility

**Rationale**: Clear organization enables independent development, deployment, and maintenance.

### 2.2 Infrastructure Organization
Infrastructure-related components MUST be organized under the `infrastructure/` directory:
- `infrastructure/docker-compose/` - Local development orchestration
- `infrastructure/kubernetes/` - Container orchestration manifests
- `infrastructure/terraform/` - GCP infrastructure as code
- `infrastructure/monitoring/` - Observability stack configuration

**Rationale**: Separating infrastructure from application code improves maintainability and deployment clarity.

### 2.3 Specification-Driven Structure
All features MUST follow the `.specify/` directory structure:
- `specs/{feature-name}/spec.md` - Requirements and user stories
- `specs/{feature-name}/plan.md` - Technical implementation plan
- `specs/{feature-name}/tasks.md` - Actionable task breakdown
- `specs/{feature-name}/contracts/` - API specifications

**Rationale**: Specification-driven development ensures requirements are clearly defined before implementation begins.

## Article III: Docker Requirements

### 3.1 Containerization Mandate
Every service MUST include:
- `Dockerfile` with multi-stage builds for production optimization
- `docker-compose.yml` for local development
- `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files
- Health check endpoints accessible within containers

**Rationale**: Consistent containerization enables reliable deployment across environments and simplifies dependency management.

### 3.2 Container Standards
All containers MUST:
- Use official base images from Docker Hub or equivalent trusted registries
- Run as non-root users for security
- Expose ports explicitly in Dockerfile
- Include appropriate labels for metadata

**Rationale**: Security and consistency requirements for container deployment.

## Article IV: Documentation Standards

### 4.1 Service Documentation
Every service MUST include a comprehensive README.md containing:
- Service purpose and functionality overview
- API endpoint documentation with examples
- Environment variable configuration
- Local development setup instructions
- Docker build and run instructions
- Testing procedures and commands

**Rationale**: Proper documentation enables independent development and reduces onboarding time.

### 4.2 GCP Deployment Documentation
Service READMEs MUST include:
- GCP deployment instructions using provided Terraform modules
- Required GCP services and permissions
- Environment-specific configuration differences
- Monitoring and logging setup for GCP

**Rationale**: Deployment consistency and operational clarity in cloud environments.

### 4.3 Service Integration Documentation
Service READMEs MUST document:
- Dependencies on other services with specific endpoints
- API contract specifications and versioning
- Authentication and authorization requirements
- Data flow and integration patterns
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

**Rationale**: Clear integration documentation prevents service coupling issues and simplifies debugging.

## Article V: Technology Standards

### 5.1 Backend Technologies
- **Python Services**: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + Pydantic + bcrypt + PyJWT
- **Node.js Services**: Express.js + Sequelize + bcrypt + jsonwebtoken
- **Go Services**: Gin framework + GORM + JWT-Go
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL (primary), Redis (caching/sessions)

### 5.2 Frontend Technologies
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict type checking
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI components
- **State Management**: React Context or Zustand for complex state

### 5.3 Infrastructure Technologies
- **Containerization**: Docker with multi-stage builds
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose (local), Kubernetes (production)
- **Cloud Platform**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana + structured logging

## Article VI: Security Standards

### 6.1 Authentication Requirements
All services MUST implement:
- JWT-based authentication with proper token validation
- Secure password hashing using bcrypt or equivalent
- Token refresh mechanisms with appropriate expiration
- Input validation and sanitization for all endpoints

### 6.2 Security Practices
All implementations MUST include:
- HTTPS enforcement in production environments
- Secrets management using environment variables
- Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning
- Proper error handling without information leakage

**Rationale**: Security is non-negotiable, even in demonstration applications.

## Article VII: Observability Requirements

### 7.1 Logging Standards
All services MUST implement:
- Structured JSON logging with consistent field names
- Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR with appropriate usage
- Request correlation IDs for distributed tracing
- No sensitive data in log outputs

### 7.2 Health Monitoring
All services MUST expose:
- `/health` endpoint returning 200 OK when service is healthy
- `/health/ready` endpoint for readiness checks
- Basic metrics (request count, response time, error rate)
- Integration with monitoring infrastructure

**Rationale**: Operational visibility is essential for debugging and performance monitoring.

## Article VIII: Testing Standards

### 8.1 Test Coverage Requirements
All services MUST include:
- Unit tests with minimum 80% code coverage
- Integration tests for database and external service interactions
- API contract tests validating endpoint specifications
- Health check endpoint validation

### 8.2 Testing Tools
- **Python**: pytest with TestClient for FastAPI
- **Node.js**: Jest with supertest for Express.js
- **Go**: Built-in testing package with testify
- **Frontend**: Jest + React Testing Library

**Rationale**: Comprehensive testing ensures reliability and facilitates refactoring.

## Article IX: Governance

### 9.1 Amendment Process
This constitution may be amended through:
1. Proposal creation with rationale and impact analysis
2. Review of affected templates and documentation
3. Version increment following semantic versioning
4. Update of all dependent artifacts

### 9.2 Compliance Review
