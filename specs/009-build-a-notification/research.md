# Research Report: Notification Service

**Date**: 2025-09-28
**Feature**: Notification Service for Project Zero App
**Status**: Complete

## Technology Decisions

### Language and Framework
**Decision**: Node.js with Express framework
**Rationale**:
- Provides technology diversity within the Project Zero App ecosystem (complementing Python FastAPI services)
- Express.js is mature, well-documented, and follows the constitution's Node.js service standards
- Aligns with constitutional requirement for demonstrable, simple implementations
- Rich ecosystem for notification-related packages

**Alternatives considered**:
- Python FastAPI (already used in other services)
- Go with Gin (would require additional learning curve)

### Database and ORM
**Decision**: SQLite with Sequelize ORM
**Rationale**:
- SQLite provides simple local development setup without external dependencies
- Sequelize ORM maintains consistency with other Node.js services in the ecosystem
- Follows constitutional principle of simplicity first
- Easy migration path to PostgreSQL for production if needed

**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct SQL queries (less maintainable)
- MongoDB with Mongoose (overkill for relational notification data)

### API Documentation
**Decision**: Swagger/OpenAPI with automatic swagger.json generation
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement for comprehensive API documentation
- Industry standard for REST API documentation
- Enables automated contract testing
- Supports integration with other services

**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual documentation (not scalable)
- GraphQL (unnecessary complexity for notification use case)

### Authentication
**Decision**: JWT integration with existing auth service
**Rationale**:
- Maintains consistency with existing authentication patterns
- Constitutional security requirement for JWT-based authentication
- Stateless operation as required
- Leverages existing auth service at port 8001

**Alternatives considered**:
- Service-to-service keys (doesn't support user-specific notifications)
- Basic auth (less secure)

### Notification Providers
**Decision**: Mock email and SMS providers
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional demo-focused development principle
- Avoids external service dependencies and API keys
- Simulates realistic delivery patterns without actual sending
- Easier testing and development

**Alternatives considered**:
- Real providers like SendGrid/Twilio (adds complexity and external dependencies)
- File-based logging (less realistic simulation)

### Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Jest with supertest for API testing
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional testing standard for Node.js services
- Supertest provides excellent HTTP assertion capabilities
- Jest offers comprehensive test runner with coverage reporting
- Supports both unit and integration testing

**Alternatives considered**:
- Mocha + Chai (Jest is more comprehensive)
- Custom test framework (unnecessary complexity)

## Integration Patterns

### Service Communication
**Decision**: HTTP REST API calls to other services
**Rationale**:
- Consistent with existing service architecture
- Simple request/response patterns
- Easy to test and debug
- Follows microservice communication standards

**Service Integration Points**:
- Auth Service (port 8001): JWT token verification
- Order Service (port 8008): Order event notifications
- Payment Service (port 8009): Payment event notifications
- User Profile Service (port 8002): User contact preferences

### Data Flow
**Decision**: Event-driven notification triggers with immediate delivery
**Rationale**:
- Supports real-time notification requirements
- Simple request-response pattern for triggering
- Stateless operation as required
- Easy to trace and debug

**Alternatives considered**:
- Message queue patterns (adds infrastructure complexity)
- Polling mechanisms (less responsive)

## Architecture Patterns

### Service Structure
**Decision**: Standard microservice with controllers, services, models pattern
**Rationale**:
- Follows established patterns in the codebase
- Clear separation of concerns
- Testable components
- Constitutional simplicity principle

### Error Handling
**Decision**: Structured error responses with proper HTTP status codes
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement for proper error handling
- Consistent with REST API standards
- Enables proper client-side error handling
- Supports debugging and monitoring

### Logging
**Decision**: Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional observability requirement
- Enables distributed tracing across services
- Supports monitoring and debugging
- No sensitive data exposure

## Performance Considerations

### Notification Delivery
**Decision**: Synchronous delivery simulation with configurable delays
**Rationale**:
- Mock providers allow realistic timing simulation
- Synchronous approach simplifies error handling
- Configurable delays support testing different scenarios
- Meets demo-focused requirements

### Database Operations
**Decision**: Standard CRUD operations with Sequelize optimizations
**Rationale**:
- SQLite adequate for demo purposes
- Sequelize provides query optimization
- Standard patterns for maintainability
- Migration path to PostgreSQL available

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
**Decision**: Comprehensive request validation using Express middleware
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional security standard requirement
- Prevents injection attacks
- Validates notification content and recipients
- Supports error reporting

### Sensitive Data Handling
**Decision**: No sensitive data logging, secure token handling
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional security principle
- Protects user privacy
- Prevents credential exposure
- Maintains audit trail without sensitive information

## Deployment Strategy

### Containerization
**Decision**: Docker with multi-stage builds and health checks
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional Docker requirement
- Consistent deployment across environments
- Health checks for monitoring
- Non-root user for security

### Service Discovery
**Decision**: Static configuration with environment variables
**Rationale**:
- Simple configuration management
- Supports both local and container environments
- Easy to modify for different deployment scenarios
- Follows established patterns in the codebase

## Development Workflow

### Local Development
**Decision**: Direct Node.js execution with hot reload
**Rationale**:
- Fast development cycle
- Easy debugging
- Consistent with Node.js best practices
- Supports integration testing with other services

### Testing Approach
**Decision**: TDD with contract tests first, then implementation
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional testing requirement
- Ensures API contracts are met
- Drives implementation from requirements
- Supports integration verification

## Conclusion

All technology decisions align with the constitutional principles of simplicity first, demo-focused development, and established patterns. The research phase has resolved all technical unknowns and provides a clear foundation for Phase 1 design work.

**Ready for Phase 1**: Data model design and API contract generation.
