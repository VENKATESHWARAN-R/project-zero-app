# Feature Specification: API Gateway Service

**Feature Branch**: `008-build-an-api`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build an API gateway service for the Project Zero App e-commerce platform. This service acts as the single entry point for all client requests, routing them to appropriate backend microservices. The gateway should handle request routing to all our services (auth service on port 8001, user profile service on port 8002, product catalog service on port 8004, cart service on port 8007, order service on port 8008, payment service on port 8009), implement rate limiting to prevent abuse, provide authentication middleware that verifies JWT tokens with the auth service, enable CORS for frontend integration, and include request/response logging for monitoring. The gateway should route requests based on URL patterns (e.g., /api/auth/* to auth service, /api/products/* to product catalog, /api/cart/* to cart service, /api/orders/* to order service, /api/payments/* to payment service, /api/profile/* to user profile service). Include health checks for all downstream services, load balancing capabilities for future scaling, request timeout handling, and proper error responses when services are unavailable. The gateway should be lightweight, high-performance, and serve as the central coordination point for our microservices architecture. Keep the implementation focused on essential gateway functionality without over-engineering."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a client application (frontend web app, mobile app, or third-party integration), I need a single, reliable entry point to access all e-commerce platform services so that I can provide a seamless user experience without managing multiple service endpoints directly.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a client needs to authenticate a user, **When** they send a request to `/api/auth/login`, **Then** the gateway routes the request to the auth service and returns the response
2. **Given** an authenticated user wants to view products, **When** they send a request to `/api/products/search` with valid JWT token, **Then** the gateway validates the token and routes to the product catalog service
3. **Given** a client makes too many requests, **When** they exceed the rate limit threshold, **Then** the gateway blocks additional requests and returns appropriate error responses
4. **Given** a backend service is unavailable, **When** a client makes a request to that service, **Then** the gateway detects the failure and returns a meaningful error message with proper HTTP status codes
5. **Given** multiple clients accessing the platform simultaneously, **When** they make requests to different services, **Then** the gateway efficiently routes all requests without performance degradation

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a downstream service takes too long to respond?
- How does the gateway handle malformed requests or invalid routes?
- What occurs when the auth service is down but users try to access protected endpoints?
- How does the system behave under high load when rate limits are reached?
- What happens when JWT tokens are expired or invalid?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST route incoming requests to appropriate backend services based on URL patterns
- **FR-002**: System MUST enforce rate limiting to prevent abuse and protect backend services
- **FR-003**: System MUST authenticate requests by validating JWT tokens with the auth service
- **FR-004**: System MUST enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) for frontend application integration
- **FR-005**: System MUST log all requests and responses for monitoring and debugging purposes
- **FR-006**: System MUST perform health checks on all downstream services
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle request timeouts gracefully and return appropriate error responses
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide meaningful error messages when services are unavailable
- **FR-009**: System MUST support load balancing for future horizontal scaling requirements
- **FR-010**: System MUST serve as the single entry point for all client requests to the platform
- **FR-011**: System MUST route `/api/auth/*` requests to the authentication service
- **FR-012**: System MUST route `/api/profile/*` requests to the user profile service
- **FR-013**: System MUST route `/api/products/*` requests to the product catalog service
- **FR-014**: System MUST route `/api/cart/*` requests to the cart service
- **FR-015**: System MUST route `/api/orders/*` requests to the order service
- **FR-016**: System MUST route `/api/payments/*` requests to the payment service
- **FR-017**: System MUST maintain high performance and low latency for request routing

### Key Entities
- **Gateway Route**: Represents URL pattern mapping to backend service endpoints, including path matching rules and target service information
- **Rate Limit Policy**: Defines request throttling rules per client, including limits, time windows, and enforcement actions
- **Service Health Status**: Tracks availability and response times of downstream services for routing decisions
- **Request Log Entry**: Contains request metadata, routing decisions, response times, and error information for monitoring
