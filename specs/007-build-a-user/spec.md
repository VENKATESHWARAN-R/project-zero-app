# Feature Specification: User Profile Management Service

**Feature Branch**: `007-build-a-user`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a user profile management service for the Project Zero App e-commerce platform. This service manages comprehensive user information beyond basic authentication including user profiles, shipping addresses, billing addresses, user preferences, and account settings. Users should be able to view and update their profile information, manage multiple shipping addresses, set default addresses, update account preferences, and view account activity. The service should handle user profile data like full name, phone number, date of birth, profile picture URL, email preferences, and notification settings. Include address management with support for multiple shipping and billing addresses, address validation, and default address selection. The service should integrate with the auth service for user verification and with the order service for address information during checkout. Include endpoints for getting user profile, updating profile information, managing addresses (add, update, delete, set default), managing preferences, and account activity tracking. Keep the profile model comprehensive but focused on essential e-commerce user data that enhances the shopping experience."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ï¿½  Feature description provided
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ï¿½  Identified: user profiles, address management, preferences, activity tracking
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ï¿½ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: User role permissions and admin access levels]
   ï¿½ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Profile picture upload/storage mechanism]
   ï¿½ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Address validation rules and geographic coverage]
   ï¿½ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Account activity retention period]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ï¿½  Clear user flows identified
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ï¿½  Requirements are testable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ï¿½  Data entities identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ï¿½ ï¿½ WARN "Spec has uncertainties - clarification needed"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning after clarification)
```

## ï¿½ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-27
- Q: User role permissions and admin access levels â†’ A: Two-level system - regular users access own data only, admin users can view any profile for support but cannot modify other users' personal information
- Q: Profile picture upload/storage mechanism â†’ A: URL-based storage where users provide profile picture URLs with validation for proper image formats
- Q: Address validation rules and geographic coverage â†’ A: Basic validation on required fields (street, city, state/province optional, postal code, country) without complex geographic validation
- Q: Account activity retention period â†’ A: Retain activity indefinitely with created_at/updated_at timestamps for audit purposes

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a customer of the Project Zero e-commerce platform, I want to manage my personal profile information, shipping and billing addresses, and account preferences so that I can have a personalized shopping experience with faster checkout and relevant communications.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new authenticated user with basic account, **When** they access their profile page, **Then** they see a form to complete their profile with personal information fields
2. **Given** a user with a complete profile, **When** they update their phone number, **Then** the change is saved and reflected immediately in their profile
3. **Given** a user adding their first shipping address, **When** they save the address, **Then** it becomes their default shipping address automatically
4. **Given** a user with multiple addresses, **When** they select a different default shipping address, **Then** the previous default is updated and the new address becomes the default
5. **Given** a user during checkout, **When** they select an address, **Then** the order service can retrieve their address information for shipping calculation
6. **Given** a user managing their preferences, **When** they disable email notifications, **Then** they stop receiving promotional emails but still receive order-related communications
7. **Given** a user viewing their account activity, **When** they access the activity log, **Then** they see a chronological list of significant account actions

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to delete their only shipping address?
- How does the system handle invalid address data during entry?
- What occurs when a user updates their profile while an order is being processed?
- How does the system respond when the auth service is unavailable during profile operations?
- What happens when address validation fails for an international address?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
