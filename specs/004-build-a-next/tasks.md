## Dependencies

### Critical Path

- T033 (base API client) blocks T030-T032 (service clients)
- T034-T036 (stores) depend on T030-T032 (services) and T025-T029 (types)
- T045 (Header) depends on T034 (auth store) and T035 (cart store)
- T058 (root layout) depends on T045 (Header) and T046 (Footer)
- T069-T071 (auth flow) depend on T034 (auth store) and T030 (auth service)

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Setup Phase
```bash
# Launch dependency installation together (T002-T005):
Task: "Install core dependencies (Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)"
Task: "Install state management and form libraries (Zustand, react-hook-form, zod)"
Task: "Install UI component libraries (shadcn/ui, lucide-react)"
Task: "Install API and testing dependencies (axios, jest, react-testing-library)"
```

### Contract Tests Phase
```bash
# Launch API contract tests together (T012-T014):
Task: "Auth API contract test in frontend/tests/contract/auth-api.test.ts"
Task: "Products API contract test in frontend/tests/contract/products-api.test.ts"
Task: "Cart API contract test in frontend/tests/contract/cart-api.test.ts"
```

### Type Definitions Phase
```bash
# Launch type definitions together (T025-T029):
Task: "User types in frontend/src/types/user.ts"
Task: "Product types in frontend/src/types/product.ts"
Task: "Cart types in frontend/src/types/cart.ts"
Task: "API response types in frontend/src/types/api.ts"
Task: "Form types in frontend/src/types/forms.ts"
```

### Component Development Phase
```bash

Task: "ProductCard component in frontend/src/components/product/ProductCard.tsx"
Task: "ProductList component in frontend/src/components/product/ProductList.tsx"
Task: "SearchBar component in frontend/src/components/product/SearchBar.tsx"
Task: "ProductFilters component in frontend/src/components/product/ProductFilters.tsx"
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies between them
- All tests must fail before implementing corresponding functionality (TDD)
- Use TypeScript strict mode for better type safety
- Follow Next.js 14 App Router conventions
- Implement mobile-first responsive design
- Use Zustand for global state management
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
- JWT tokens stored in localStorage with proper refresh logic

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From Contracts**: Each contract file → test task (T012-T014) and service implementation (T030-T032)
2. **From Data Model**: Each entity → type definition (T025-T029) and store (T034-T036)
3. **From User Stories**: Authentication, browsing, and cart flows → integration tests (T022-T024)
4. **Ordering**: Setup → Tests → Types → Services → Components → Pages → Integration → Polish

## Validation Checklist

- [x] Parallel tasks are truly independent (marked with [P])
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] TDD approach: tests written first and must fail
