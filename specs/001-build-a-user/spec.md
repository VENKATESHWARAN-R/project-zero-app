# Feature Specification: User Authentication Service

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-user`
**Created**: 2025-09-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a user authentication service for an e-commerce platform called Project Zero App. This service handles user login, logout, and JWT token management. Users should be able to authenticate with email and password, receive JWT access and refresh tokens upon successful login, and logout to invalidate tokens. The service should validate JWT tokens for other services and provide token refresh functionality when access tokens expire. Include basic rate limiting for login attempts and simple password validation. The service should be stateless and work as a microservice that other services can call for authentication verification. Keep the implementation simple but functional - focus on core authentication flows rather than advanced security features for now. Include endpoints: POST /auth/login, POST /auth/logout, POST /auth/refresh, and GET /auth/verify. The service should return consistent JSON responses with proper HTTP status codes. Keep user data minimal - just email, password hash, and user ID for now."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identified: users, authentication, JWT tokens, login/logout, rate limiting, password validation, API endpoints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Clear user flows identified for login, logout, token refresh, token verification
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A customer wants to access their account on Project Zero App e-commerce platform. They submit their credentials via the login endpoint, receive secure tokens that allow them to access protected resources, and can safely logout when finished. Other services in the platform can verify user authentication by checking tokens through the verification endpoint. The system protects against brute force attacks and maintains security while providing a smooth user experience through consistent API responses.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user with valid email and password, **When** they POST to /auth/login, **Then** they receive access and refresh tokens with proper HTTP status and JSON response
2. **Given** an authenticated user with valid tokens, **When** they POST to /auth/logout, **Then** their tokens are invalidated and they receive confirmation
3. **Given** a user with an expired access token but valid refresh token, **When** they POST to /auth/refresh, **Then** they receive a new access token
4. **Given** other services need to verify user authentication, **When** they GET /auth/verify with a token, **Then** the service confirms if the token is valid and returns user information
5. **Given** a user makes multiple failed login attempts, **When** they exceed the rate limit, **Then** further attempts are temporarily blocked with appropriate error response
6. **Given** invalid or malformed requests, **When** sent to any endpoint, **Then** the service returns consistent error responses with proper HTTP status codes

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to login with invalid credentials multiple times?
- How does the system handle expired refresh tokens during refresh attempts?
- What occurs when a user attempts to use invalidated tokens after logout?
- How does the service respond when other microservices send malformed authentication requests?
- What happens when required fields are missing from API requests?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide POST /auth/login endpoint for user authentication with email and password
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide POST /auth/logout endpoint to invalidate user tokens
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide POST /auth/refresh endpoint to refresh expired access tokens
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide GET /auth/verify endpoint for other services to validate tokens
- **FR-005**: System MUST return consistent JSON responses with proper HTTP status codes for all endpoints
- **FR-006**: System MUST generate and return both access and refresh tokens upon successful login
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate user passwords according to basic security criteria [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific password requirements not defined - minimum length, character requirements, etc.]
- **FR-008**: System MUST implement rate limiting for login attempts to prevent brute force attacks [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific rate limits not specified - attempts per time period, lockout duration]
- **FR-009**: System MUST operate as a stateless microservice that other services can call for authentication verification
- **FR-010**: System MUST reject authentication attempts with invalid or expired tokens
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle concurrent authentication requests reliably
- **FR-012**: System MUST store minimal user data: user ID, email, and password hash only
- **FR-013**: System MUST return appropriate error messages and status codes for invalid requests

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents a customer account with user ID, email, and password hash (minimal data set)
- **Access Token**: Short-lived JWT token that grants access to protected resources
- **Refresh Token**: Longer-lived JWT token used to obtain new access tokens
- **Authentication Session**: Represents an active user session with associated tokens
- **Rate Limit Record**: Tracks login attempts per user for rate limiting purposes
- **API Response**: Standardized JSON response format with consistent structure and HTTP status codes
