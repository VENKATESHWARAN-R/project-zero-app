# Implementation Plan: User Authentication Service

**Branch**: `001-build-a-user` | **Date**: 2025-09-23 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-build-a-user/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Authentication microservice for Project Zero App e-commerce platform. Provides JWT-based authentication with login/logout, token refresh, and verification endpoints. Uses FastAPI with SQLite database, bcrypt password hashing, and in-memory token blacklist for logout functionality. Service runs on port 8001 and exposes REST API for other microservices.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, bcrypt, PyJWT, python-multipart, uvicorn
**Storage**: SQLite (local development), upgradeable to PostgreSQL
**Testing**: pytest with FastAPI test client
**Target Platform**: Linux server/Docker container
**Project Type**: web (backend microservice)
**Performance Goals**: Basic rate limiting (5 attempts per minute per user)
**Constraints**: Stateless operation, port 8001, minimal dependencies
**Scale/Scope**: Single authentication microservice, 4 API endpoints, minimal user data model

$ARGUMENTS: Implement this authentication service using Python with FastAPI framework. Use SQLite database for simplicity in local development (we can upgrade to PostgreSQL later). Use bcrypt for password hashing and PyJWT for JWT token management. The service should run on port 8001 and expose REST API endpoints. Include basic SQLAlchemy models for users and a simple in-memory token blacklist for logout functionality. Use Pydantic models for request/response validation. Include basic logging and a health check endpoint. Keep dependencies minimal - just FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, bcrypt, PyJWT, and python-multipart... (whichever is needed and feel free to add few more if needed)

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**✅ Simplicity First**: Using FastAPI with minimal dependencies (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, bcrypt, PyJWT)
**✅ Functionality Over Complexity**: Core authentication flows without advanced security features
**✅ Progressive Enhancement**: Starting with SQLite, upgradeable to PostgreSQL later
**✅ Demo-Focused**: Demonstrable authentication service with working endpoints
**✅ Backend Simplicity**: FastAPI with minimal dependencies as per constitution
**✅ One Responsibility**: Service does exactly one thing - authentication
**✅ Stateless Services**: JWT-based stateless authentication service
**✅ Security Patterns**: JWT tokens, bcrypt password hashing, rate limiting
**✅ Basic Logging**: JSON structured logging included
**✅ Health Checks**: /health endpoint included
**✅ Technology Constraints**: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + Pydantic as specified

**PASS**: All constitutional requirements met

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - Backend microservice for e-commerce platform

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete

**Gate Status**:
