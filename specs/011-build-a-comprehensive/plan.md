# Implementation Plan: Comprehensive RAG-Ready Documentation System

**Branch**: `011-build-a-comprehensive` | **Date**: 2025-09-29 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/011-build-a-comprehensive/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Create a comprehensive, enterprise-grade documentation system for Project Zero App that serves as a foundation for RAG agent demonstrations. The system will organize documentation in a structured `docs/` directory with service-specific folders for all 9 backend services plus frontend, containing realistic technical documentation, operational procedures, incident management, disaster recovery plans, compliance materials, and organizational contacts using dummy but authentic data to mirror real-world enterprise IT systems.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Markdown documentation format with consistent structure  
**Primary Dependencies**: Existing Project Zero App services (9 backend + frontend)  
**Storage**: File-based documentation system in `docs/` directory hierarchy  
**Testing**: Documentation validation through cross-references and structural consistency  
**Target Platform**: RAG agent consumption with enterprise IT documentation patterns  
**Project Type**: Documentation system for existing web application (9 microservices + frontend)  
**Performance Goals**: RAG-optimized structure for complex operational queries  
**Constraints**: Realistic but demo-appropriate content, comprehensive 500-2000 word documents  
**Scale/Scope**: 10 service areas × 10 document types × realistic organizational structure with incident history

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Article I: Core Philosophy**
- ✅ Simplicity First: Documentation system uses standard markdown files with clear hierarchy
- ✅ Functionality Over Architecture: Focus on usable documentation content over complex tooling
- ✅ Progressive Enhancement: Start with core service docs, expand to specialized areas
- ✅ Demo-Focused Development: Realistic but demo-appropriate content for RAG demonstrations

**Article II: Project Organization**
- ✅ Service Structure: Documentation mirrors existing services/ directory organization
- ✅ Infrastructure Organization: Documentation includes infrastructure/ references
- ✅ Specification-Driven Structure: This feature follows .specify/ directory requirements

**Article IV: Documentation Standards**
- ✅ Service Documentation: Each service gets comprehensive README.md enhancement
- ✅ GCP Deployment Documentation: Infrastructure docs include GCP deployment guidance
- ✅ Service Integration Documentation: Integration guides show service dependencies

**Article VII: Observability Requirements**
- ✅ Monitoring Standards: Documentation includes monitoring and alerting guidance
- ✅ Health Monitoring: Documentation covers health check and readiness procedures

**Constitutional Compliance**: PASS - Documentation system aligns with constitutional principles

**Structure Decision**: Documentation system (docs/ directory) - no source code changes needed for existing web application

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base template
- Generate directory structure creation tasks (docs/ hierarchy with 10 service areas)
- Create document creation tasks based on documentation structure contract
- Generate content population tasks using content creation contract guidelines
- Create validation and quality assurance tasks for structural and content compliance

**Ordering Strategy**:
- **Phase 1**: Directory structure creation (can be parallelized)
- **Phase 2**: Template and contract document creation (foundational)
- **Phase 3**: Service-specific documentation (can be parallelized by service)
- **Phase 4**: Cross-cutting documentation (shared, contacts, compliance)
- **Phase 5**: Integration and cross-reference tasks
- **Phase 6**: Validation and quality assurance tasks

**Task Categories**:
1. **Infrastructure Tasks [P]**: Create directory structures, copy templates
2. **Contract Tasks**: Create documentation standards and requirements
3. **Service Documentation Tasks [P]**: Per-service documentation creation (README, API docs, architecture, operations, incidents, etc.)
4. **Organizational Tasks**: Contact directories, escalation matrices, team structures
5. **Compliance Tasks**: Privacy policies, security audits, PCI DSS documentation
6. **Integration Tasks**: Cross-references, master index, navigation aids
7. **Quality Tasks**: Content validation, cross-reference checking, RAG testing

**Estimated Output**: 35-45 numbered, ordered tasks covering:
- 10 service documentation sets (frontend + 9 backend services)
- 6 shared documentation areas (contacts, compliance, infrastructure, etc.)
- Quality assurance and validation tasks
- RAG agent testing and optimization tasks

**Task Parallelization**: Tasks marked [P] can be executed in parallel as they operate on independent file sets and directory structures

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
