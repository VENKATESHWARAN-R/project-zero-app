# Research: User Profile Management Service

**Generated**: 2025-09-27 | **Phase**: 0 | **Status**: Complete

## Architecture Research

### Service Structure Decision
**Decision**: Follow existing microservice pattern with dedicated `services/user-profile-service/` directory
**Rationale**: Maintains consistency with auth-service and order-service organizational patterns
**Alternatives considered**: Monolithic approach rejected for architectural consistency

### Technology Stack Validation
**Decision**: Python 3.13 + FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + Pydantic + pytest
**Rationale**: Matches constitutional requirements and existing service patterns exactly
**Alternatives considered**: Other Python frameworks rejected for consistency and team familiarity

### Database Architecture
**Decision**: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production with SQLAlchemy ORM
**Rationale**: Follows established pattern from auth-service and order-service
**Alternatives considered**: Direct SQL rejected for ORM benefits, other databases rejected for consistency

### Authentication Integration Pattern
**Decision**: JWT token verification with local decode + remote auth service fallback
**Rationale**: Analyzed order-service integration pattern - provides performance with reliability
**Alternatives considered**: Remote-only verification rejected for latency, local-only rejected for security

### API Design Pattern
**Decision**: RESTful API with OpenAPI/Swagger auto-generation using FastAPI
**Rationale**: Matches existing service patterns and provides excellent developer experience
**Alternatives considered**: GraphQL rejected for consistency, custom API rejected for standards compliance

## Key Implementation Patterns Identified

### 1. Directory Structure
- **Standard Structure**: `src/` for application code, consistent module organization
- **API Organization**: Router-based approach with health, profiles, admin endpoints
- **Testing Structure**: contract/, integration/, unit/ test categories
- **Configuration**: Pydantic Settings for environment variable management

### 2. Database Patterns
- **Model Design**: SQLAlchemy declarative base with audit fields (created_at, updated_at)
- **Session Management**: Dependency injection for database sessions
- **Migration Strategy**: Alembic integration for schema changes
- **Connection Pooling**: Environment-specific engine configuration

### 3. API Patterns
- **Request/Response**: Pydantic models with validation and OpenAPI documentation
- **Error Handling**: Consistent HTTP status codes with structured error responses
- **Middleware**: Correlation ID tracking, CORS, and structured logging
- **Dependencies**: FastAPI dependency injection for auth, database, services

### 4. Security Patterns
- **JWT Integration**: Token verification matching auth service secret key
- **Input Validation**: Pydantic models with field constraints and sanitization
- **Error Information**: No sensitive data exposure in error responses
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of profile access and modifications

### 5. Testing Patterns
- **Contract Tests**: API endpoint validation with request/response schemas
- **Integration Tests**: Service-to-service communication testing
- **Unit Tests**: Business logic and model testing with 80%+ coverage
- **Test Database**: SQLite-based test database with proper cleanup

### 6. Docker Integration
- **Multi-stage Build**: Builder stage for dependencies, production stage for runtime
- **Security**: Non-root user execution with proper file permissions
- **Health Checks**: Built-in health endpoint integration
- **Environment**: Configurable through environment variables

### 7. Observability Patterns
- **Structured Logging**: JSON format with correlation IDs and contextual information
- **Health Endpoints**: `/health` and `/health/ready` with dependency checks
- **Metrics**: Request tracking and performance monitoring readiness
- **Error Tracking**: Comprehensive error logging without sensitive data

## Service Integration Research

### Auth Service Integration
- **Token Verification**: Use JWT secret key matching auth service configuration
- **User Identity**: Extract user_id from validated JWT tokens
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when auth service unavailable
- **Performance**: Local JWT decode with remote verification fallback

### Order Service Integration
- **Address Data**: Provide shipping and billing address information during checkout
- **Data Consistency**: Ensure address changes don't break active orders
- **API Contract**: RESTful endpoints for address retrieval by user_id
- **Availability**: Handle order service requests even during profile updates

### Future Service Integration
- **Cart Service**: User preferences for cart behavior and saved items
- **Notification Service**: Email/SMS preferences and communication settings
- **Payment Service**: Billing address information for payment processing
- **Product Service**: User preferences for product recommendations

## Performance and Scalability Research

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: Target <200ms p95 latency for all profile operations
- **Throughput**: Support 1000+ requests/second for profile reads
- **Database**: Optimized queries with proper indexing on user_id and common lookups
- **Caching**: Redis integration readiness for frequently accessed profile data

### Scalability Patterns
- **Stateless Design**: No server-side session state, JWT-based authentication
- **Database Scaling**: Read replicas readiness for profile data access
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Container-based deployment with load balancer support
- **Resource Management**: Memory and CPU optimization for high user volumes

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Auth Service Dependency**: Local JWT validation provides fallback capability
- **Database Performance**: Indexing strategy and query optimization required
- **Data Consistency**: Address management requires careful handling of active orders
- **Integration Complexity**: Multiple service dependencies require robust error handling

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Circuit Breaker**: Implement for external service calls
- **Graceful Degradation**: Core profile operations continue during service outages
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and observability for proactive issue detection

## Constitutional Compliance Validation

### ✅ Simplicity First
- Using proven FastAPI patterns from existing services
- Minimal complexity in initial implementation
- Progressive enhancement approach for advanced features

### ✅ Functionality Over Architecture
- Focus on essential profile management features first
- Architectural patterns support immediate business value
- No over-engineering beyond current requirements

### ✅ Demo-Focused Development
- Prioritizes demonstrable profile management capabilities
- Security and observability features for demonstration purposes
- Production-ready patterns without production-scale optimization

## Ready for Phase 1

All technical unknowns resolved. No NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers remain. Service integration patterns validated. Constitutional compliance confirmed. Ready to proceed with data model design and API contract specification.
