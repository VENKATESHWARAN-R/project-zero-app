# Feature Specification: Product Catalog Service

**Feature Branch**: `002-build-a-product`
**Created**: 2025-09-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a product catalog service for the Project Zero App e-commerce platform. This service manages all product information including product details, categories, pricing, and availability. Users should be able to browse all products, view individual product details by ID, filter products by category, and search products by name or description. Include basic product data like name, description, price, category, image URL, stock quantity, and active status. The service should provide endpoints to list all products with pagination, get specific product details, filter products by category, and search products by text. Keep the product model simple but realistic for e-commerce - include sample product data for demonstration. The service should be stateless and integrate with the auth service for any admin operations like adding/updating products. Public endpoints for browsing and searching should not require authentication."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a customer visiting the e-commerce platform, I want to browse and search through available products so I can find items I'm interested in purchasing. I should be able to view detailed information about each product, filter by categories to narrow my search, and see current pricing and availability. As an admin user, I need to manage the product catalog by adding new products and updating existing product information to keep the catalog current and accurate.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I am on the product catalog page, **When** I view the product list, **Then** I see all available products with basic information (name, price, image) displayed with pagination
2. **Given** I want to see more details about a product, **When** I select a specific product, **Then** I see complete product information including description, price, category, stock status, and image
3. **Given** I am looking for products in a specific category, **When** I filter by category, **Then** I see only products belonging to that category
4. **Given** I want to find specific products, **When** I search using product name or description keywords, **Then** I see matching products in the results
5. **Given** I am an authenticated admin user, **When** I add a new product with all required details, **Then** the product appears in the catalog and is available for customers to view
6. **Given** I am an authenticated admin user, **When** I update existing product information, **Then** the changes are reflected immediately in the catalog

### Edge Cases

- What happens when no products match the search criteria? System displays empty results with helpful message
- How does system handle invalid product IDs when requesting details? System returns appropriate error message
- What happens when admin tries to add product without authentication? System denies access and requires authentication
- How does pagination work when product count changes during browsing? System maintains consistent pagination experience

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to view a paginated list of all active products
- **FR-002**: System MUST display basic product information including name, price, and image in product listings
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to view complete details of individual products by product identifier
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide filtering capability to show products by category
- **FR-005**: System MUST enable text-based search across product names and descriptions
- **FR-006**: System MUST support pagination for product listings to handle large catalogs
- **FR-007**: System MUST store product information including name, description, price, category, image URL, stock quantity, and active status
- **FR-008**: System MUST only display products marked as active to public users
- **FR-009**: System MUST require authentication for administrative operations like adding or updating products
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow authenticated admin users to add new products to the catalog

- **FR-012**: System MUST provide sample product data for demonstration purposes
- **FR-013**: System MUST operate in a stateless manner without maintaining user session data
- **FR-014**: System MUST integrate with the existing auth service for admin authentication verification
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide specific endpoints: GET /products (list with pagination), GET /products/{id} (product details), GET /products/category/{category} (filter by category), GET /products/search?q={query} (search), POST /products (admin - add product), PUT /products/{id} (admin - update product)
- **FR-016**: System MUST return consistent JSON responses and handle errors gracefully with appropriate HTTP status codes
- **FR-017**: System MUST include comprehensive sample product data with at least 20 products across different categories including electronics, clothing, books, and home goods

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Product**: Represents items available in the e-commerce catalog with attributes including unique identifier, name, description, price, category, image URL, stock quantity, and active status flag. Products can be filtered by category and searched by text content.
- **Category**: Classification system for organizing products into logical groups to enable filtering and browsing by product type.
