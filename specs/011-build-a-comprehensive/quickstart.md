# Quickstart Guide: Documentation System Setup

**Date**: 2025-09-29  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Prerequisites**: Project Zero App repository access, markdown editor  
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours for complete setup  

## Overview

This guide walks through setting up the comprehensive RAG-ready documentation system for Project Zero App. The system provides enterprise-grade documentation structure with realistic content suitable for demonstrating RAG agent capabilities.

## Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### 1. Verify Project Structure
Ensure you're in the Project Zero App root directory with existing services:
```bash
ls -la services/
# Should show: api-gateway-service, auth-service, cart-service, etc.
```

### 2. Create Documentation Root
```bash
mkdir -p docs/{services,shared,contacts,compliance,infrastructure,templates,archives}
```

### 3. Create Service Documentation Directories
```bash
# Create directories for all 10 services (frontend + 9 backend)
for service in frontend api-gateway auth-service product-catalog-service cart-service order-service payment-service user-profile-service notification-service; do
  mkdir -p "docs/services/${service}"/{api-docs,architecture,operations,incidents,disaster-recovery,integration,security,monitoring,deployment,troubleshooting}
done
```

### 4. Verify Structure
```bash
tree docs/ -d -L 3
# Should show complete hierarchy
```

## Content Creation Workflow

### Phase 1: Core Service Documentation (45 minutes)

#### 1. Service README Files
Create comprehensive README.md for each service:
```bash
# Example for auth-service
cat > docs/services/auth-service/README.md << 'EOF'
# Authentication Service Documentation

**Service**: auth-service  
**Port**: 8001  
**Technology**: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy  
**Owner**: Backend Services Team  
**On-Call**: [See contacts/engineering-teams.md]  

## Quick Links
- [API Documentation](./api-docs/)
- [Architecture Overview](./architecture/overview.md)
- [Operational Runbooks](./operations/runbooks.md)
- [Recent Incidents](./incidents/)
- [Security Policies](./security/)

## Service Overview
Central authority for user identity, credential validation, token issuance and verification for Project Zero App platform.

```

#### 2. API Documentation
Create OpenAPI specifications and endpoint documentation:
```bash
# Copy actual OpenAPI spec from service
cp services/auth-service/swagger.json docs/services/auth-service/api-docs/openapi-spec.json

# Create human-readable API guide
# Include authentication flows, rate limiting, error handling
```

#### 3. Architecture Documentation
Document system design and technology choices:
```bash
# Create architecture overview with ASCII diagrams
# Document ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
# Explain service boundaries and integration patterns
```

### Phase 2: Operational Documentation (60 minutes)

#### 1. Runbooks and SOPs
Create step-by-step operational procedures:
```bash
# Standard operating procedures with exact commands
# Deployment procedures with rollback steps
# Configuration management with examples
```

#### 2. Incident Documentation
Create realistic incident reports:
```bash
# 5-10 incidents per major service
# Complete timeline, root cause, resolution
# Lessons learned and action items
```

#### 3. Monitoring and Alerting
Document monitoring setup and alert configurations:
```bash
# Prometheus queries, Grafana dashboard configs
# SLI/SLO definitions with thresholds
# Escalation procedures and runbooks
```

### Phase 3: Organizational Documentation (30 minutes)

#### 1. Contact Directory
Create realistic organizational structure:
```bash
cat > docs/contacts/engineering-teams.md << 'EOF'
# Engineering Teams

## Frontend Team
**Team Lead**: Sarah Johnson <sarah.johnson@projectzero.demo>
**Senior Developer**: Mike Chen <mike.chen@projectzero.demo>
**Slack Channel**: #frontend-team
**On-Call Schedule**: frontend-oncall

```

#### 2. Escalation Matrix
Define incident escalation procedures:
```bash
# Primary → Secondary → Manager → Director escalation
# Service-specific escalation paths
# Emergency contact procedures
```

### Phase 4: Compliance Documentation (45 minutes)

#### 1. Data Privacy Policy
Create GDPR-style data handling policies:
```bash
# Data collection and processing purposes
# User rights and request procedures
# Data retention and deletion policies
```

#### 2. Security Audit Reports
Generate realistic security assessment findings:
```bash
# Vulnerability assessments with CVSS scores
# Penetration testing results
# Remediation timelines and status
```

#### 3. PCI DSS Compliance
Create payment processing compliance documentation:
```bash
# Payment data handling procedures
# Compliance monitoring and validation
# Audit trail and reporting
```

## Validation and Testing

### 1. Structure Validation
```bash
# Verify all required directories exist
find docs/ -type d | wc -l
# Should be 100+ directories

# Check for required files
find docs/ -name "README.md" | wc -l
# Should be 10+ files (one per service)
```

### 2. Content Quality Check
```bash
# Validate markdown syntax
find docs/ -name "*.md" -exec markdownlint {} \;

# Check word counts
for file in $(find docs/services -name "*.md" -not -name "README.md"); do
  words=$(wc -w < "$file")
  echo "$file: $words words"
done
```

### 3. Cross-Reference Validation
```bash
# Check for broken internal links
find docs/ -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "\[.*\](\./" {} \; | \
  xargs -I {} bash -c 'echo "Checking {}" && markdown-link-check {}'
```

## RAG Agent Testing

### 1. Simple Queries
Test basic factual questions:
- "What port does the auth service run on?"
- "Who is the on-call engineer for the frontend team?"
- "What is the data retention policy for user accounts?"

### 2. Complex Queries
Test analytical questions:
- "What were the common causes of auth service outages and how were they resolved?"
- "What security vulnerabilities were found in the last audit and what was the remediation plan?"
- "What is the escalation path for a critical payment processing incident?"

### 3. Cross-Service Queries
Test integration understanding:
- "How does the order service integrate with the payment service and what are the key failure modes?"
- "What monitoring alerts would fire if the auth service becomes unavailable?"

## Maintenance Procedures

### 1. Regular Updates
- Update incident reports as new incidents occur
- Refresh contact information quarterly
- Review and update compliance documentation annually

### 2. Version Control
- Maintain version numbers in document metadata
- Document change rationale in change logs
- Schedule regular review dates

### 3. Quality Assurance
- Validate cross-references monthly
- Review content for accuracy quarterly
- Update technical examples when services change

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Missing Directories
If documentation directories are missing:
```bash
# Re-run directory creation script
chmod +x scripts/create-docs-structure.sh
./scripts/create-docs-structure.sh
```

#### Broken Cross-References
If links between documents are broken:
```bash
# Use relative paths from document location
# Example: ../shared/system-architecture.md
```

#### Inconsistent Metadata
If document headers are inconsistent:
```bash
# Use template from docs/templates/document-template.md
# Validate with metadata checker script
```

## Next Steps

After completing the quickstart setup:

1. **Content Creation**: Use the content creation contract to populate all documents with realistic, detailed content
2. **RAG Integration**: Point your RAG agent to the docs/ directory and begin testing queries
3. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly update documentation based on actual Project Zero App changes
4. **Team Training**: Share the documentation structure with team members for ongoing maintenance
