# Research: API Gateway Implementation in Go

**Feature**: API Gateway Service
**Research Date**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Complete

## Research Summary

This document consolidates research findings for implementing a high-performance API gateway service in Go using the Gin framework. The research covers architecture patterns, technology choices, implementation strategies, and production considerations.

## 1. Go API Gateway Architecture Patterns

### Decision: Single Gateway with Middleware-Based Architecture
**Rationale**: Implement a centralized API gateway using Go's `net/http/httputil.NewSingleHostReverseProxy()` with Gin's middleware chaining for cross-cutting concerns.

**Implementation Approach**:
- Native Go reverse proxy for optimal performance
- Configuration-based service discovery with health checking
- Middleware chain for authentication, rate limiting, and logging
- Circuit breaker pattern for resilience

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Traefik/Envoy**: Rejected due to complexity and over-engineering for demo purposes
- **Custom HTTP multiplexer**: Rejected due to lack of middleware ecosystem
- **Microgateway pattern**: Deferred for future consideration

## 2. Rate Limiting Strategy

### Decision: Token Bucket Algorithm using `golang.org/x/time/rate`
**Rationale**: Standard library implementation provides reliability and performance without external dependencies.

**Implementation Strategy**:
- In-memory rate limiter with per-client tracking
- Global rate: 100 requests/second with burst of 200
- Per-client rate: 10 requests/second with burst of 20
- Periodic cleanup of inactive limiters

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Redis-based rate limiting**: Rejected for simplicity; can be added later for multi-instance deployment
- **Fixed window rate limiting**: Rejected due to burst traffic handling limitations
- **Sliding window**: Rejected due to memory overhead

## 3. Circuit Breaker Implementation

### Decision: Sony Gobreaker Library
**Rationale**: Production-tested, configurable failure detection, and excellent integration with middleware patterns.

**Configuration Strategy**:
- MaxRequests: 3 (half-open state)
- Interval: 60 seconds (failure counting window)
- Timeout: 30 seconds (open state duration)
- ReadyToTrip: 60% failure ratio with minimum 3 requests

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Hystrix-Go**: Rejected due to maintenance status and complexity
- **cep21/circuit**: Considered for performance but sony/gobreaker chosen for maturity
- **Custom implementation**: Rejected due to complexity and testing requirements

## 4. Structured Logging

### Decision: Go 1.21+ slog (Standard Library)
**Rationale**: Official standard library solution with excellent performance, zero external dependencies, and future-proof design.

**Implementation Features**:
- Correlation ID support for distributed tracing
- Context-aware logging with request metadata
- JSON structured output for log aggregation
- Configurable log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Logrus**: Rejected due to performance and standard library preference
- **Zap**: Considered for extreme performance but slog chosen for simplicity
- **zerolog**: Rejected due to external dependency

## 5. JWT Authentication Middleware

### Decision: Custom Middleware with External Auth Service Validation
**Rationale**: Aligns with microservice architecture and maintains centralized authentication logic.

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Extract JWT from Authorization header
- Validate token with auth service `/auth/verify` endpoint
- Implement token caching with 2-5 minute TTL
- Include retry logic with exponential backoff

**Security Features**:
- Secure token extraction and validation
- Rate limiting for auth service calls
- Proper error handling without information leakage
- HTTPS enforcement for token transmission

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Local JWT verification**: Rejected due to key management complexity
- **gin-jwt library**: Rejected due to external dependency and customization needs
- **OAuth2 proxy**: Rejected due to over-engineering for demo requirements

## 6. Docker Configuration

### Decision: Multi-Stage Alpine-Based Dockerfile
**Rationale**: Optimal balance of security, size, and functionality for production deployment.

**Security Features**:
- Non-root user execution (appuser:1001)
- Minimal Alpine base image (3.19)
- Static binary compilation
- Certificate authority bundle included
- Build-time dependency separation

**Optimization Results**:
- Expected final image size: 15-20MB
- No build tools in production image
- Stripped debugging symbols for security

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Distroless images**: Considered but Alpine chosen for debugging capabilities
- **Scratch image**: Rejected due to lack of CA certificates and debugging tools
- **Ubuntu base**: Rejected due to large image size

## 7. Configuration Management

### Decision: Viper with Environment Variable Precedence
**Rationale**: Flexible configuration sources, validation capabilities, and hot-reload support for operational efficiency.

**Configuration Strategy**:
- YAML configuration files with environment variable overrides
- Built-in validation using struct tags
- Hot-reload capability for operational changes
- Hierarchical configuration structure

**Environment Variable Mapping**:
- `SERVER_PORT` → server.port
- `SERVICES_AUTH_URL` → services.auth.url
- `RATE_LIMIT_GLOBAL` → rate_limit.global

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Pure environment variables**: Rejected due to lack of structure and validation
- **cleanenv library**: Considered but Viper chosen for feature richness
- **JSON configuration**: Rejected in favor of YAML for readability

## 8. Service Discovery and Health Checks

### Decision: Configuration-Based Service Registry with Health Polling
**Rationale**: Simple, reliable approach suitable for the demo environment with clear upgrade path.

**Implementation Approach**:
- Static service configuration with URL mapping
- Periodic health check polling (30-second intervals)
- Graceful failover to healthy service instances
- Circuit breaker integration for failure handling

**Health Check Strategy**:
- HTTP GET requests to `/health` endpoints
- 5-second timeout with 3 retry attempts
- Binary health status (healthy/unhealthy)
- Exponential backoff for failed services

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Consul/etcd integration**: Rejected due to complexity for demo environment
- **Kubernetes service discovery**: Deferred for future cloud deployment
- **DNS-based discovery**: Rejected due to health check limitations
