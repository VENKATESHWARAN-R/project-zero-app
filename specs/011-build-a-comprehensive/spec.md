# Feature Specification: Comprehensive RAG-Ready Documentation System

**Feature Branch**: `011-build-a-comprehensive`
**Created**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a comprehensive documentation system for the Project Zero App that mirrors real-world enterprise IT documentation to serve as the foundation for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) agent demonstrations. Create extensive, well-organized documentation in the docs/ directory covering all aspects of the e-commerce platform including technical documentation, operational procedures, incident management, disaster recovery, business processes, and compliance materials. The documentation should be organized by service with each service having its own documentation folder containing API documentation, architecture and design documents, standard operating procedures (SOPs), runbooks, incident response guides, disaster recovery plans, integration guides, troubleshooting guides, configuration management docs, security policies, monitoring and alerting documentation, change management procedures, deployment guides, and business context documents. Include realistic dummy data for contacts (on-call engineers, team leads, vendors, support contacts), service level agreements (SLAs), compliance requirements, audit logs documentation, and vendor management information. The documentation should cover the frontend application and all 9 backend services (api-gateway, auth-service, product-catalog-service, cart-service, order-service, payment-service, user-profile-service, notification-service). Create documentation in markdown format with proper structure, cross-references between documents, realistic technical details, and sufficient depth to enable a RAG agent to answer complex questions about system operations, troubleshooting, architecture decisions, and incident response. The documentation should feel authentic and comprehensive like a real enterprise IT system with years of accumulated knowledge."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a developer, operations engineer, or RAG agent, I want to access a comprehensive and well-structured documentation system for the Project Zero App that mirrors real-world enterprise IT systems, so that I can quickly find detailed information about the system's architecture, operations, procedures, contacts, incident history, and compliance requirements with sufficient depth to answer complex operational questions.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the documentation system is created, **When** I navigate to the `docs/` directory, **Then** I should see a clear hierarchy with service-specific folders (frontend + 9 services), shared documentation, templates, and archives folders with standardized subdirectory structure.
2. **Given** I open a service's documentation folder, **When** I look inside the standardized subdirectories (api-docs/, architecture/, operations/, incidents/, disaster-recovery/, integration/, security/, monitoring/, deployment/), **Then** I should find comprehensive 500-2000 word markdown files with specific technical details, real examples, code snippets, and realistic scenarios.
3. **Given** I open a documentation file, **When** I read it, **Then** it should contain realistic and detailed information including version history, authors (dummy names), last updated dates, document ownership, past incidents, lessons learned, known issues, and workarounds that make it feel lived-in and authentic.
4. **Given** I need contact information, **When** I access the organizational structure documentation, **Then** I should find realistic dummy contacts for engineering teams, management, on-call rotations with escalation procedures, vendor contacts, and external stakeholders with complete contact methods.
5. **Given** I need incident information, **When** I access incident documentation, **Then** I should find 5-10 realistic past incident reports per major service with post-mortem documents including timeline, root cause analysis, and action items.
6. **Given** I need compliance information, **When** I access compliance documentation, **Then** I should find realistic policies covering data privacy (GDPR-like), PCI DSS considerations, security audit reports, penetration testing results, access control policies, and data retention policies.
7. **Given** the comprehensive documentation is in place, **When** a RAG agent is pointed to the `docs/` directory, **Then** it should be able to answer complex questions about system operations, troubleshooting, architecture decisions, incident response, and compliance with meaningful detail.

### Edge Cases

- **Missing Documentation Files**: When cross-references point to missing documents, the system should handle this gracefully with clear "document not found" messages or placeholders that maintain the documentation structure.
- **Documentation Updates and Version Control**: Changes to the actual services should trigger documentation updates. There should be a clear process for maintaining version history, updating authors, and managing document ownership when the system evolves.
- **Contact Information Currency**: The dummy organizational structure should include realistic scenarios for role changes, team restructuring, and contact information updates to mirror real enterprise environments.
- **Incident Documentation Consistency**: Historical incident reports should maintain consistency with the current system architecture while showing realistic evolution over time, including references to deprecated components or previous system versions.
- **Compliance Documentation Currency**: Compliance documents should reflect realistic scenarios for regulatory changes, audit findings, and remediation efforts while maintaining demo-appropriate content that doesn't expose real vulnerabilities.
- **Cross-Service Documentation Dependencies**: When services have integration points, their documentation should cross-reference appropriately and handle scenarios where dependent service documentation is updated independently.
- **RAG Agent Query Complexity**: The documentation should be structured to handle both simple factual queries ("What is the auth service port?") and complex analytical queries ("What were the common causes of payment service outages and how were they resolved?").

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST create a `docs/` directory at the root of the project with standardized subdirectory structure including service-specific folders, shared documentation folder for cross-cutting concerns, templates folder for document templates, and archives folder for historical documents.
- **FR-002**: The `docs/` directory MUST contain a sub-directory for the `frontend` application with standardized subdirectories: api-docs/, architecture/, operations/, incidents/, disaster-recovery/, integration/, security/, monitoring/, and deployment/.
- **FR-003**: The `docs/` directory MUST contain sub-directories for each of the 9 backend services: `api-gateway`, `auth-service`, `product-catalog-service`, `cart-service`, `order-service`, `payment-service`, `user-profile-service`, `notification-service` with the same standardized subdirectory structure.
- **FR-004**: Each service/application directory within `docs/` MUST contain comprehensive markdown files for documentation categories with 500-2000 words each including specific technical details, real examples from services, actual code snippets, and realistic scenarios.
- **FR-005**: The documentation MUST be in Markdown format with consistent naming conventions and include an index.md in each folder explaining the contents.
- **FR-006**: The documentation MUST include realistic dummy data for organizational structure with dummy contacts (engineering teams, management, on-call rotations with escalation procedures, vendor contacts, external stakeholders) including contact methods (email addresses, phone numbers, Slack channels, PagerDuty schedules).
- **FR-007**: The documentation MUST include realistic incident documentation with 5-10 past incident reports per major service covering outages, performance issues, security events, data inconsistencies, post-mortem documents with timeline, root cause analysis, and action items.
- **FR-008**: The documentation MUST include disaster recovery plans with RTO/RPO definitions, backup and restoration procedures, failover processes, business continuity plans, runbooks for common operational tasks and troubleshooting guides for known issues.
- **FR-009**: The documentation MUST include realistic compliance documentation covering data privacy policies (GDPR-like requirements), PCI DSS considerations for payment service, security audit reports, penetration testing results, access control policies, data retention policies, and change management logs.
- **FR-010**: The documentation MUST be detailed and comprehensive enough for a RAG agent to effectively answer complex operational questions with realistic details like past incidents, lessons learned, known issues, and workarounds.
- **FR-011**: The documentation MUST include version history, authors (using dummy names), last updated dates, and document ownership to make the documentation feel lived-in and authentic.
- **FR-012**: The documentation MUST include cross-references between related documents and maintain consistency across all services.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29

- Q: Documentation depth and realism ‚Üí A: Create detailed, realistic documentation that mirrors actual enterprise IT systems. Each document should be 500-2000 words with specific technical details, real examples from our services, actual code snippets where relevant, and realistic scenarios. Include version history, authors (use dummy names), last updated dates, and document ownership. Make the documentation feel lived-in with realistic details like past incidents, lessons learned, known issues, and workarounds. The goal is to create documentation that a RAG agent can meaningfully query to answer real operational questions.

- Q: Contact and personnel information ‚Üí A: Create a realistic organizational structure with dummy contacts including engineering teams (frontend team, backend services team, DevOps/SRE team, security team, QA team), management (engineering managers, product managers, technical leads), on-call rotations with escalation procedures, vendor contacts (cloud provider support, monitoring tool vendors, payment gateway support), and external stakeholders (compliance auditors, security consultants). Include contact methods (email addresses, phone numbers, Slack channels, PagerDuty schedules) using dummy data. Organize this in a contacts directory with role-based and service-based contact lists.

- Q: Documentation organization structure ‚Üí A: Organize documentation with a clear hierarchy - top-level docs/ directory containing service-specific folders (one for each of the 9 services plus frontend), shared documentation folder for cross-cutting concerns, templates folder for document templates, and archives folder for historical documents. Each service folder should contain standardized subdirectories: api-docs/, architecture/, operations/, incidents/, disaster-recovery/, integration/, security/, monitoring/, and deployment/. Use consistent naming conventions and include an index.md in each folder explaining the contents.

- Q: Incident and disaster recovery documentation ‚Üí A: Create realistic incident documentation including past incident reports (5-10 realistic incidents per major service covering outages, performance issues, security events, data inconsistencies), post-mortem documents with timeline, root cause analysis, and action items, disaster recovery plans with RTO/RPO definitions, backup and restoration procedures, failover processes, and business continuity plans. Include runbooks for common operational tasks and troubleshooting guides for known issues. Make these documents specific to our actual services with realistic scenarios.

- Q: Compliance and audit documentation ‚Üí A: Include realistic compliance documentation covering data privacy policies (GDPR-like requirements), PCI DSS considerations for payment service, security audit reports, penetration testing results (dummy findings and remediation), access control policies, data retention policies, and change management logs. Create sample audit trails and compliance checklists. Keep these realistic but appropriate for a demo system.
