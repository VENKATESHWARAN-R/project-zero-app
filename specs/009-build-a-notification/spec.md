# Feature Specification: Notification Service

**Feature Branch**: `009-build-a-notification`
**Created**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a notification service for the Project Zero App e-commerce platform following our constitution of simplicity first and functionality over complexity. This service handles all communication with users including email notifications, SMS notifications, and in-app notifications. The service should send notifications for key events like user registration welcome messages, order confirmations, payment confirmations, order status updates, password reset notifications, and promotional communications. Include endpoints for sending immediate notifications, scheduling notifications, retrieving notification history for users, and managing notification templates. The service should integrate seamlessly with our existing services: auth service for user verification, order service for order-related notifications, payment service for payment confirmations, and user profile service for user contact preferences. Keep the implementation simple but realistic using mock email/SMS providers for demonstration purposes. The service should be stateless, lightweight, and follow our established patterns for microservice integration. Ensure comprehensive documentation and proper integration with other services through clear API contracts."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature description provided: notification service for e-commerce platform
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: users, system administrators, other microservices
   ’ Actions: send notifications, schedule notifications, manage templates, retrieve history
   ’ Data: notifications, templates, delivery history, user preferences
   ’ Constraints: stateless, lightweight, mock providers for demo
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Clear user flows identified for notification delivery and management
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a customer of the Project Zero App e-commerce platform, I need to receive timely and relevant notifications about my account activities and order status so that I stay informed about important events and can take appropriate actions when needed.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user registers for an account, **When** the registration is completed, **Then** the user receives a welcome email with account activation instructions
2. **Given** a user places an order, **When** the order is confirmed, **Then** the user receives an order confirmation notification via their preferred communication channel
3. **Given** an order status changes (e.g., shipped, delivered), **When** the status update occurs, **Then** the user receives a notification about the status change
4. **Given** a user initiates a password reset, **When** the reset request is processed, **Then** the user receives a password reset notification with secure reset instructions
5. **Given** a payment is processed for an order, **When** the payment is confirmed, **Then** the user receives a payment confirmation notification
6. **Given** a user has notification preferences set, **When** any notification is sent, **Then** the notification is delivered only through the user's preferred channels
7. **Given** an administrator wants to send promotional communications, **When** they schedule a promotional notification, **Then** the notification is delivered to eligible users at the specified time
8. **Given** a user wants to review their notification history, **When** they request their notification history, **Then** they can view all notifications sent to them within a specified time period

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user's email address is invalid or SMS number is unreachable?
- How does the system handle notification delivery failures and retry logic?
- What happens when a user changes their notification preferences while notifications are scheduled?
- How does the system prevent duplicate notifications for the same event?
- What happens when the notification service is temporarily unavailable?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST send immediate notifications for critical events (user registration, order confirmation, payment confirmation, password reset)
- **FR-002**: System MUST support multiple notification channels (email, SMS, in-app notifications)
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow scheduling of notifications for future delivery
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain a complete history of all notifications sent to users
- **FR-005**: System MUST support notification templates that can be customized with dynamic content
- **FR-006**: System MUST integrate with the auth service to verify user identity and obtain user contact information
- **FR-007**: System MUST integrate with the order service to receive order-related event notifications
- **FR-008**: System MUST integrate with the payment service to receive payment event notifications
- **FR-009**: System MUST respect user notification preferences retrieved from the user profile service
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide endpoints for other services to trigger immediate notifications
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide endpoints for administrators to manage notification templates
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide endpoints for users to retrieve their notification history
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle notification delivery failures gracefully with appropriate retry mechanisms
- **FR-014**: System MUST prevent sending duplicate notifications for the same event to the same user
- **FR-015**: System MUST support promotional and marketing communications with proper opt-in/opt-out mechanisms
- **FR-016**: System MUST use mock email and SMS providers for demonstration purposes
- **FR-017**: System MUST operate in a stateless manner without requiring persistent sessions
- **FR-018**: System MUST validate all incoming notification requests to prevent unauthorized usage
- **FR-019**: System MUST log all notification activities for auditing and troubleshooting purposes
- **FR-020**: System MUST provide health check endpoints for monitoring service availability

### Key Entities

- **Notification**: Represents a communication sent to a user, containing recipient information, content, delivery channel, status, and timestamps
- **NotificationTemplate**: Represents a reusable template for notifications, containing template content, variables for dynamic content, and template metadata
- **NotificationHistory**: Represents the historical record of notifications sent to users, including delivery status, timestamps, and failure reasons
- **NotificationPreference**: Represents user preferences for receiving notifications, including preferred channels and opt-in/opt-out settings for different notification types
- **ScheduledNotification**: Represents notifications scheduled for future delivery, containing scheduling information and notification content
- **DeliveryProvider**: Represents the interface to external communication providers (email, SMS) for actual message delivery
