## Payment Processing Workflow

### Payment Intent Flow

```text
1. CREATE INTENT ─── Order Service Request
   ↓
2. VALIDATE ORDER ─── Verify order details
   ↓
3. CREATE PAYMENT ─── Generate payment intent
   ↓
4. AUTHORIZE ──────── Payment method authorization
   ↓
5. CAPTURE ────────── Funds capture and settlement
   ↓
6. COMPLETE ────────── Update order and notify
```

### Payment Status States

- **PENDING**: Payment intent created, awaiting confirmation
- **AUTHORIZED**: Payment method authorized, funds reserved
- **CAPTURED**: Funds captured and transferred
- **FAILED**: Payment processing failed
- **CANCELLED**: Payment cancelled before processing
- **REFUNDED**: Payment refunded (full or partial)

## Security and PCI Compliance
