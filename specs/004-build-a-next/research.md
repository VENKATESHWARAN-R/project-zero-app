# Research: Next.js Frontend Application for Project Zero E-commerce Platform

**Date**: 2025-09-24
**Status**: Complete

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Framework Choice: Next.js 14 with App Router
**Decision**: Use Next.js 14 with the new App Router
**Rationale**:
- App Router provides better developer experience with server components and streaming
- Built-in optimization for performance (automatic code splitting, image optimization)
- Excellent TypeScript support out of the box
- Strong ecosystem and community support
- Aligns with constitutional requirement for modern React patterns

**Alternatives considered**:
- Create React App (deprecated, lacks modern features)
- Vite + React (requires more configuration, lacks Next.js optimizations)
- Remix (steeper learning curve, less ecosystem)

### 2. State Management: Zustand
**Decision**: Use Zustand for global state management
**Rationale**:
- Lightweight and simple API compared to Redux
- Excellent TypeScript support
- No boilerplate code required
- Perfect for authentication and cart state management
- Follows constitutional simplicity principles

**Alternatives considered**:
- React Context (can cause unnecessary re-renders with complex state)
- Redux Toolkit (more complex setup and boilerplate)
- Jotai (atomic approach might be overkill)

### 3. Styling: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI
**Decision**: Use Tailwind CSS with Shadcn UI components
**Rationale**:
- Utility-first approach enables rapid development
- Excellent responsive design support
- Shadcn UI provides accessible, customizable components
- Aligns with constitutional frontend technology standards
- Reduces custom CSS and maintains consistency

**Alternatives considered**:
- CSS Modules (more verbose, less flexible)
- Styled Components (runtime overhead, not aligned with standards)
- Pure CSS (time-consuming, harder to maintain)

### 4. Form Handling: React Hook Form
**Decision**: Use React Hook Form with Zod validation
**Rationale**:
- Excellent performance with minimal re-renders
- Built-in validation support
- Great TypeScript integration with Zod schemas
- Follows modern React patterns
- Handles complex form scenarios well

**Alternatives considered**:
- Formik (heavier, more complex API)
- Native form handling (lacks validation features)
- React Final Form (less active maintenance)

### 5. API Communication: Axios
**Decision**: Use Axios for HTTP requests
**Rationale**:
- Better error handling than fetch
- Request/response interceptors for JWT token management
- Built-in request/response transformation
- Timeout and retry capabilities
- Well-established and reliable

**Alternatives considered**:
- Native fetch (lacks interceptors, more manual error handling)
- SWR/React Query (adds complexity for simple API calls)

### 6. Authentication Strategy: JWT with localStorage
**Decision**: Store JWT tokens in localStorage with proper security measures
**Rationale**:
- Simple implementation for demonstration purposes
- Persists across browser sessions
- Easy to implement with Axios interceptors
- Follows backend service JWT implementation

**Alternatives considered**:
- Cookies (more complex setup, CSRF considerations)
- SessionStorage (doesn't persist across sessions)
- In-memory only (lost on page refresh)

### 7. Testing Strategy: Jest + React Testing Library
**Decision**: Use Jest with React Testing Library for testing
**Rationale**:
- Industry standard for React testing
- Follows constitutional testing requirements
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Good integration with Next.js
- Focuses on user-centric testing

**Alternatives considered**:
- Cypress (e2e testing, different scope)
- Vitest (newer, less ecosystem support)

### 8. TypeScript Configuration
**Decision**: Use strict TypeScript configuration with proper interfaces
**Rationale**:
- Catches errors at compile time
- Better developer experience with IntelliSense
- Ensures type safety across API boundaries
- Aligns with constitutional requirements
- Improves code maintainability

**Alternatives considered**:
- JavaScript (lacks type safety benefits)
- Loose TypeScript config (reduces error catching)

### 9. Error Handling Strategy
**Decision**: Implement error boundaries with toast notifications
**Rationale**:
- Prevents application crashes
- Provides user-friendly error messages
- Enables error recovery mechanisms
- Follows React best practices

**Alternatives considered**:
- Basic try-catch only (poor user experience)
- Console logging only (not user-facing)

### 10. Performance Optimization
**Decision**: Implement lazy loading and code splitting
**Rationale**:
- Improves initial page load time
- Better user experience on slower connections
- Follows constitutional performance goals
- Next.js provides built-in support

**Alternatives considered**:
- Loading everything upfront (poor performance)
- Manual chunking (more complex setup)

## Backend Integration Analysis

### Service Endpoints
1. **Auth Service (localhost:8001)**
   - POST /auth/login
   - POST /auth/logout
   - POST /auth/refresh
   - GET /auth/verify
   - POST /auth/register (planned)

2. **Product Catalog Service (localhost:8004)**
   - GET /products
   - GET /products/{id}
   - GET /products?category={category}
   - GET /products?search={query}

3. **Cart Service (localhost:8007)**
   - GET /cart
   - POST /cart/items
   - PUT /cart/items/{id}
   - DELETE /cart/items/{id}
   - DELETE /cart

### API Client Architecture
- Base Axios instance with common configuration
- Interceptors for JWT token attachment
- Centralized error handling
- Type-safe request/response interfaces
- Retry logic for failed requests

## Implementation Approach

### Directory Structure
```

```

### Key Implementation Considerations
1. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind breakpoints
2. **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
3. **SEO**: Next.js metadata API for proper head tags
4. **Performance**: Image optimization and lazy loading
5. **Security**: Input sanitization and XSS prevention

## Risks and Mitigations

### High Risk
- **JWT Token Security**: Mitigate with proper token refresh and secure storage
- **State Synchronization**: Mitigate with Zustand's atomic updates

### Medium Risk
- **API Integration**: Mitigate with proper error handling and fallbacks
- **Performance on Mobile**: Mitigate with optimization and testing

### Low Risk
- **Browser Compatibility**: Next.js handles most compatibility issues
- **TypeScript Complexity**: Team has TypeScript experience

## Success Criteria
- All pages load within 3 seconds
- Responsive design works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- JWT authentication flow works seamlessly
- Cart state persists across page refreshes
- All forms have proper validation
- Error states are handled gracefully
- Code coverage meets constitutional requirements (80%+)

## Next Steps
Phase 1 will focus on:
1. Data model definition based on API responses
2. API contract specifications
3. Component architecture design
4. Implementation task breakdown
