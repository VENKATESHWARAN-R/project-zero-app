# Tasks: Comprehensive RAG-Ready Documentation System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/011-build-a-comprehensive/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)

```text
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: Documentation system for 10 services (frontend + 9 backend)
   → Tech stack: Markdown with structured hierarchy
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract documentation entities
   → contracts/: Documentation structure and content requirements
   → research.md: Enterprise documentation patterns
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Directory structure, templates, index files
   → Core: Service-specific documentation for all 10 services
   → Shared: Cross-cutting documentation, contacts, compliance
   → Integration: Cross-references, navigation, consistency
   → Polish: README updates, validation, optimization
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different services/directories = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same files = sequential (no [P])
   → Structure before content
   → Templates before document creation
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate completeness: All services documented, all categories covered
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files/directories, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Documentation system uses `docs/` directory structure at repository root.

## Dependencies

### Critical Path Dependencies

- T001 (root structure) blocks T002-T010 (service directories)
- T011-T014 (templates) block incident and SOP creation tasks
- T015-T021 (index files) needed before content creation
- Service README files (T022, T030, T041, etc.) block detail documentation
- Templates completion before incident report generation (T127-T135)
- All content creation before integration tasks (T136-T140)
- Integration completion before final tasks (T141-T145)

### Service-Level Dependencies

Each service follows pattern: README → API docs → Architecture → Operations → Incidents → Integration

### Parallel Execution Groups

- **Setup Phase**: T002-T010 (service directories), T011-T014 (templates), T016-T021 (index files)
- **Service READMEs**: T022, T030, T041, T051, T060, T069, T078, T087, T094
- **API Documentation**: T023-T025, T031-T033, T042-T043, T052-T053, etc.
- **Architecture Documentation**: T024, T034-T035, T044, T054-T055, etc.
- **Incident Reports**: T127-T135 (all service incident reports)
- **Compliance Documentation**: T117-T122

## Parallel Example

```bash
# Launch service directory creation (T002-T010):
Task: "Create service directories for frontend: docs/services/frontend/{api-docs,architecture,operations,incidents,disaster-recovery,integration,security,monitoring,deployment,troubleshooting}/"
Task: "Create service directories for api-gateway: docs/services/api-gateway/{api-docs,architecture,operations,incidents,disaster-recovery,integration,security,monitoring,deployment,troubleshooting}/"
Task: "Create service directories for auth-service: docs/services/auth-service/{api-docs,architecture,operations,incidents,disaster-recovery,integration,security,monitoring,deployment,troubleshooting}/"
# ... (continue for all services)

# Launch service README creation after directory setup:
Task: "Create frontend service overview: docs/services/frontend/README.md"
Task: "Create API gateway service overview: docs/services/api-gateway/README.md"
Task: "Create auth service overview: docs/services/auth-service/README.md"
# ... (continue for all services)
```

## Notes

- [P] tasks target different files/directories with no dependencies
- Service documentation follows consistent structure across all 10 services
- Incident reports require realistic scenarios based on service technology and common failure modes
- Templates must be created before using them for standardized documents
- Cross-references and navigation added after content creation
- Commit after each major phase completion
- Maintain realistic word counts (500-2000 words per major document)

## Task Generation Rules

- Each service gets comprehensive documentation across all categories
- Incident reports reflect realistic scenarios for each service type
- Templates enable consistent documentation patterns
- Integration documentation shows actual service dependencies
- Compliance materials reflect enterprise requirements
- All documentation optimized for RAG agent consumption with clear structure and cross-references
