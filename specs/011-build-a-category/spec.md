# Feature Specification: Category Management Service

**Feature Branch**: `011-build-a-category`
**Created**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a category management service for the Project Zero App e-commerce platform following our constitution of simplicity first and functionality over complexity. This service manages advanced product categorization including hierarchical categories, subcategories, category metadata, and category-based product organization. The service should handle category creation and management, support nested category structures (parent-child relationships), provide category-based product filtering and navigation, include category metadata like descriptions and images, and enable category-based product recommendations. Include endpoints for listing all categories in hierarchy, getting category details with product counts, managing category relationships (parent-child), creating and updating categories (admin only), and retrieving products by category with enhanced filtering options. The service should integrate seamlessly with our existing product catalog service to enhance product organization and with the auth service for admin operations. Keep the implementation simple but realistic, focusing on essential category management that enhances product discovery and navigation. The service should be stateless, lightweight, and follow our established patterns for microservice integration. Ensure comprehensive documentation and proper integration with existing services through clear API contracts."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an e-commerce platform operator, I need a category management system that allows customers to easily discover products through intuitive hierarchical navigation while enabling administrators to organize products into logical, nested categories with rich metadata to improve product discoverability and enhance the shopping experience.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a customer browsing the platform, **When** they want to find electronics products, **Then** they can navigate through categories like "Electronics" ’ "Mobile Devices" ’ "Smartphones" to find relevant products
2. **Given** an administrator managing the product catalog, **When** they create a new category "Gaming Laptops" under "Electronics" ’ "Computers", **Then** the category appears in the hierarchy and can be assigned to products
3. **Given** a customer viewing a category page, **When** they access "Smartphones", **Then** they see all products in that category plus any subcategories, with filtering options and product counts
4. **Given** an administrator organizing products, **When** they move a category from one parent to another, **Then** all products in that category and its subcategories maintain their associations
5. **Given** a customer searching for products, **When** they use category-based filtering, **Then** they can combine categories with other filters to narrow down results effectively

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an administrator tries to create a circular category hierarchy (e.g., making a parent category a child of its own descendant)?
- How does the system handle deletion of a category that has subcategories and products assigned to it?
- What occurs when a category is accessed that has been deleted or moved?
- How does the system behave when product counts become inconsistent due to concurrent operations?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow administrators to create new categories with name, description, and optional image metadata
- **FR-002**: System MUST support hierarchical category structures with parent-child relationships up to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum nesting depth not specified - 3 levels, 5 levels, unlimited?]
- **FR-003**: System MUST prevent creation of circular category hierarchies where a category becomes its own ancestor
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow administrators to update category information including name, description, images, and parent relationships
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow administrators to delete categories with appropriate handling of subcategories and product associations
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide category listings that show the complete hierarchy with product counts for each category
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow retrieval of products by category including products from subcategories
- **FR-008**: System MUST integrate with the existing product catalog service to maintain product-category associations
- **FR-009**: System MUST authenticate administrative operations through the existing auth service
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide category-based product filtering with enhanced options (price range, availability, ratings)
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain category metadata including descriptions and image references
- **FR-012**: System MUST support moving categories between parents while preserving product associations
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide category details including product counts and subcategory information
- **FR-014**: System MUST enable category-based product recommendations by suggesting related categories
- **FR-015**: System MUST ensure data consistency between category service and product catalog service

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Category**: Represents a product classification with name, description, optional image, parent relationship, and hierarchical position. Contains metadata for organization and display purposes.
- **Category Hierarchy**: Represents the tree structure of categories showing parent-child relationships, depth levels, and navigation paths for product organization.
- **Product-Category Association**: Links products from the catalog service to one or more categories, enabling categorization and filtering capabilities.
- **Category Metadata**: Stores additional information about categories including descriptions, images, SEO data, and display preferences for enhanced user experience.
