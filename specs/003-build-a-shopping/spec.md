# Feature Specification: Shopping Cart Service

**Feature Branch**: `003-build-a-shopping`
**Created**: 2025-09-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a shopping cart service for the Project Zero App e-commerce platform. This service manages user shopping sessions and cart operations. Users should be able to add products to their cart, remove items, update item quantities, view their current cart contents, and clear their entire cart. The cart should be associated with authenticated users and persist cart items temporarily. Include endpoints for adding items to cart, removing specific items, updating quantities, getting full cart contents with product details, and clearing the cart. The service should validate that products exist by calling the product catalog service and verify user authentication through the auth service. Cart items should include product ID, quantity, and be associated with the user ID. The service should handle quantity limits and provide cart totals including item count and total price. Keep the cart model simple but functional for a realistic e-commerce shopping experience."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Feature description provided: Shopping cart service for e-commerce platform
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: authenticated users
   � Actions: add, remove, update, view, clear cart items
   � Data: cart items (product ID, quantity, user association)
   � Constraints: product validation, authentication, quantity limits
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the specific quantity limits per item?]
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How long should cart data persist without user activity?]
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should cart items be saved across user sessions/devices?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Clear user flow: browse � add to cart � manage cart � proceed to checkout
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � All requirements are testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities
   � Cart, CartItem, User (from auth service), Product (from catalog service)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � WARN "Spec has uncertainties" - some clarifications needed
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with noted clarifications)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an authenticated user browsing the Project Zero App e-commerce platform, I want to collect products in a shopping cart so that I can review my selections, adjust quantities, and proceed to purchase multiple items together in a single transaction.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is authenticated and viewing a product, **When** they choose to add the product to their cart with a specified quantity, **Then** the product is added to their cart and they can see the updated cart count
2. **Given** a user has items in their cart, **When** they view their cart contents, **Then** they see all cart items with product details, quantities, individual prices, and total cart value
3. **Given** a user has a product in their cart, **When** they update the quantity of that product, **Then** the cart reflects the new quantity and updated totals
4. **Given** a user has items in their cart, **When** they remove a specific item, **Then** that item is deleted from the cart and totals are recalculated
5. **Given** a user has items in their cart, **When** they choose to clear their entire cart, **Then** all items are removed and the cart is empty
6. **Given** a user tries to add a non-existent product to their cart, **When** the system validates the product, **Then** the operation is rejected with an appropriate error message

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to add more items than the quantity limit allows?
- How does the system handle when a product becomes unavailable after being added to the cart?
- What happens when an unauthenticated user attempts cart operations?
- How does the system behave when trying to update a cart item to zero or negative quantity?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST verify user authentication before allowing any cart operations
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate that products exist in the catalog before adding them to cart
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to add products to their cart with a specified quantity via POST /cart/add endpoint
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to view their complete cart contents including product details, quantities, and totals via GET /cart endpoint
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to update the quantity of items already in their cart via PUT /cart/items/{product_id} endpoint
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to remove specific items from their cart via DELETE /cart/items/{product_id} endpoint
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to clear their entire cart at once via DELETE /cart endpoint
- **FR-008**: System MUST calculate and display cart totals including total item count and total price
- **FR-009**: System MUST enforce quantity limits when adding or updating cart items [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the specific quantity limits per item?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST associate cart data with the authenticated user's ID
- **FR-011**: System MUST persist cart items temporarily [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How long should cart data persist without user activity?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST integrate with product catalog service at http://localhost:8002 to validate products and get product details
- **FR-013**: System MUST integrate with auth service at http://localhost:8001 for user authentication verification
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle integration failures gracefully when validating products or authenticating users
- **FR-015**: Cart responses MUST include product details merged with cart item data
- **FR-016**: System MUST prevent duplicate entries of the same product (update quantity instead of creating new entry)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Cart**: Represents a user's shopping session, contains multiple cart items, associated with a user ID
- **CartItem**: Individual product entry in a cart, containing product ID, quantity, and references to both cart and product
- **User**: Authentication entity from auth service, used to associate cart ownership
- **Product**: Catalog entity from product service, validated for existence and availability
