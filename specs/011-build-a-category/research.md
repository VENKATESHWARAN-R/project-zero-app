# Research: Category Management Service

**Feature**: Category Management Service
**Date**: 2025-09-29
**Phase**: 0 - Research & Technical Clarification

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Category Hierarchy Depth Limit

**Decision**: Maximum 5 levels of nesting
**Rationale**:
- Prevents infinite recursion and performance issues
- Aligns with typical e-commerce category structures (e.g., Electronics > Computers > Laptops > Gaming Laptops > High-Performance Gaming Laptops)
- Provides sufficient depth for complex product organization without overwhelming users
- Consistent with performance goals of <200ms response time

**Alternatives considered**:
- Unlimited depth: Rejected due to performance and UX concerns
- 3 levels: Rejected as too limiting for complex product catalogs
- 10 levels: Rejected as potentially confusing for navigation

### 2. Package Manager Choice

**Decision**: Yarn for dependency management
**Rationale**:
- Specified in implementation requirements
- Faster installation and better dependency resolution than npm
- Lockfile provides deterministic builds
- Works seamlessly with Node.js ecosystem

**Alternatives considered**:
- npm: Standard but slower, already specified yarn should be used
- pnpm: More efficient but adds complexity, not specified in requirements

### 3. Database Schema Design

**Decision**: Self-referencing table with parent_id foreign key
**Rationale**:
- Simple and efficient for hierarchical data
- Sequelize has built-in support for self-associations
- Easy to query for direct children or entire subtrees
- Allows for easy migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL

**Alternatives considered**:
- Nested Set Model: More complex, better for read-heavy workloads but harder to maintain
- Materialized Path: Good for queries but harder to ensure consistency
- Adjacency List + Closure Table: Overkill for demo purposes

### 4. Authentication Integration

**Decision**: JWT token verification via auth service API calls
**Rationale**:
- Follows microservice patterns established in project
- Auth service already provides /auth/verify endpoint
- Stateless approach consistent with architectural goals
- Allows for centralized user management

**Alternatives considered**:
- Shared JWT secret: Violates service independence
- Database user replication: Adds complexity and data consistency issues

### 5. API Documentation Strategy

**Decision**: Swagger/OpenAPI with automatic generation using swagger-jsdoc + swagger-ui-express
**Rationale**:
- Follows existing patterns in project
- Auto-generates documentation from code comments
- Provides interactive API testing interface
- Saves swagger.json file as required

**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual OpenAPI spec: More work to maintain, prone to drift
- API Blueprint: Less common, fewer tooling options

### 6. Error Handling Strategy

**Decision**: Centralized error middleware with structured error responses
**Rationale**:
- Consistent error format across all endpoints
- Proper HTTP status codes for different error types
- No sensitive information leakage in error messages
- Structured logging for debugging

**Alternatives considered**:
- Per-route error handling: Leads to inconsistency
- Generic error responses: Harder to debug and less user-friendly

### 7. Product-Category Association Strategy

**Decision**: External association through product catalog service API calls
**Rationale**:
- Maintains service boundaries and data ownership
- Product catalog service owns product data
- Category service owns category data
- Loose coupling allows independent development

**Alternatives considered**:
- Duplicate product data: Violates DRY principle and data consistency
- Shared database: Tight coupling, violates microservice principles

### 8. Validation Strategy

**Decision**: express-validator for input validation with custom business rules
**Rationale**:
- Industry standard for Express.js applications
- Chainable validation rules for complex scenarios
- Good integration with error handling middleware
- Supports custom validators for business logic

**Alternatives considered**:
- Joi: Additional dependency when express-validator sufficient
- Manual validation: Error-prone and harder to maintain

## Integration Patterns

### Auth Service Integration (Port 8001)
- **Endpoint**: `GET /auth/verify`
- **Usage**: Verify admin JWT tokens for category management operations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation if auth service unavailable
- **Retry Strategy**: Single retry with exponential backoff

### Product Catalog Integration (Port 8004)
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /products?category_id={id}` - Get products by category
  - `PATCH /products/{id}` - Update product categories (if needed)
- **Usage**: Category-based product filtering and association management
- **Error Handling**: Return category info even if product service unavailable
- **Retry Strategy**: Single retry for non-critical operations

### Database Migration Strategy
- **Development**: SQLite with file-based storage
- **Production**: PostgreSQL with environment-based configuration
- **Migration**: Sequelize migrations for schema changes
- **Backup Strategy**: Database dumps before major changes

## Performance Considerations

### Query Optimization
- Index on parent_id for hierarchy queries
- Index on name for category searches
- Composite indexes for common query patterns
- Limit recursive queries to prevent infinite loops

### Caching Strategy
- In-memory caching for frequently accessed categories
- Cache invalidation on category updates
- TTL-based cache expiration
- Cache warming for common hierarchies

### Scalability Patterns
- Pagination for large category lists
- Lazy loading for category hierarchies
- Connection pooling for database access
- Horizontal scaling support through stateless design

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- Prevent circular hierarchy creation
- Validate category names for XSS prevention
- Sanitize image URLs and metadata
- Rate limiting on category creation endpoints

### Access Control
- Admin-only access for category management
- Read-only access for category viewing
- JWT token validation for all admin operations
- Audit logging for administrative actions

### Data Protection
- No sensitive data in category information
- Secure error messages without information leakage
- SQL injection prevention through ORM
- CORS configuration for frontend integration

## Development Workflow

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for database operations
- Contract tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for category hierarchies

### Documentation Requirements
- README.md with setup and API documentation
- Swagger/OpenAPI specification
- Database schema documentation
- Integration guide for other services

### Deployment Considerations
- Dockerfile with multi-stage build
- Docker-compose integration
- Environment variable configuration
- Health check endpoints for orchestration

## Conclusion

All technical clarifications have been resolved. The approach follows constitutional principles of simplicity first while providing the necessary functionality for category management. The design supports the specified requirements while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.
